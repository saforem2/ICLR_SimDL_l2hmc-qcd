abstract = {A recently proposed gauge theory for strong interactions, in which the set of planar diagrams play a dominant role, is considered in one space and one time dimension. In this case, the planar diagrams can be reduced to self-energy and ladder diagrams, and they can be summed. The gauge field interactions resemble those of the quantized dual string, and the physical mass spectrum consists of a nearly straight "Regge trajectory". {\textcopyright} 1974.},

abstract = {The behaviour of a renormalized field theory under scale transformations x → $\lambda$x; p → p/$\lambda$ can be found in a simple way when the theory is regularized by the continuous dimension method. The techniques proposed here have several applications in dimensionally regularized theories: short distance behaviour is expressed in terms of the single poles at n = 4, and all coefficients in front of the higher poles 1/(n - 4)k are expressed in terms of those of the single poles 1/(n - 4), without calculating any diagram. In some cases the Taylor series in 1/(n - 4) can be summed, leading to some exact results for the infinities of the full theory. {\textcopyright} 1973.},

abstract = {TensorFlow is an interface for expressing machine learning algorithms, and an implementation for executing such algorithms. A computation expressed using TensorFlow can be executed with little or no change on a wide variety of heterogeneous systems, ranging from mobile devices such as phones and tablets up to large-scale distributed systems of hundreds of machines and thousands of computational devices such as GPU cards. The system is flexible and can be used to express a wide variety of algorithms, including training and inference algorithms for deep neural network models, and it has been used for conducting research and for deploying machine learning systems into production across more than a dozen areas of computer science and other fields, including speech recognition, computer vision, robotics, information retrieval, natural language processing, geographic information extraction, and computational drug discovery. This paper describes the TensorFlow interface and an implementation of that interface that we have built at Google. The TensorFlow API and a reference implementation were released as an open-source package under the Apache 2.0 license in November, 2015 and are available at www.tensorflow.org.},

abstract = {We report on our recent rigorous construction of complete renormalization group trajec- tories between two fixed points for the three-dimensional phi-four model with modified propagator considered by Brydges, Mitter and Scoppola (BMS). These are discrete criti- cal trajectories which connect the ultraviolet Gaussian fixed point to the nontrivial BMS infrared fixed point which is an analogue of the Wilson–Fisher fixed point. The renor- malization group map is defined rigorously and nonperturbatively, without using the hierarchical approximation. The trajectories are constructed by a fixed point argument in a suitable Banach space of sequences, where one perturbs a nonlinear one-dimensional iteration.},

abstract = {Thermodynamic functions in the vicinity of an ordinary critical point are expected to obey asymptotic scaling laws as t=(T-Tc)Tc and the ordering field, h, approach zero. However, the optimal scaling variables are the nonlinear scaling fields, gt=t+bth2+ctt2+ and gh=h(1+cht+). The nonlinearities yield correction factors to the leading power-law (and scaling) variation of thermodynamic quantities, L, of the form (1+aLt+bLt2+), etc., where the correction amplitudes aL,bL are uniquely determined by the nonlinear scaling-field coefficients. It follows that "analytic" corrections to, e.g., the susceptibility, are directly related to those for the free energy and magnetization (in zero field). The term bth2 also generates nonanalytic contributions such as an additive, energylike term, varying as | t |1- in the zero-field susceptibility, and factors like (1+cL| h |2-1) on the critical isotherm, t=0. Irrelevant scaling fields yield further, in general distinct, nonanalytic corrections, and cause shifts in Tc and various amplitudes although "universal" ratios remain constant. {\textcopyright} 1983 The American Physical Society.},

We show that finite-size effects are important and depend on the aspect ratio of the lattice. In particular, we demonstrate how to obtain the correct massless behavior from an infinite tower of finite-size-induced masses and show that it is necessary to first take the cylindrical geometry limit in order to get correct results. In the Sommerfield model we also introduce a mass deformation to measure the mass anomalous dimension, $\gamma$m. We find that the explicit scale breaking of the lattice setup induces corrections which must be taken into account in order to reproduce $\gamma$m at the infrared fixed point. These results can be used to improve the methodology in the search for the conformal window in QCD-like theories with many flavors.},

abstract = {Differences between lattice Monte Carlo data and perturbation theory (for example the lack of asymptotic scaling) are usually associated with the 'bad' behaviour of the bare lattice coupling g0 due to the effects of large (and unknown) higher order terms in g0. In this philosophy a new, renormalised coupling g′ is defined with the aim of making the higher order coefficients of the perturbative series in g′ as small as possible. In this paper an alternative scenario is discussed where lattice artifacts are proposed as the cause of the disagreement between Monte Carlo data and the g0-perturbative series. We find that with the addition of a lattice artifact term, the usual asymptotic scaling expression in g0 is in excellent agreement with Monte Carlo data. Lattice data studied includes the string tension, the hadronic scale r0, the discrete beta function, M $\rho$, f $\pi$ and the 1P-1S splitting in charmonium.},

In a first application we analyze action and Polyakov line data from a Monte Carlo simulation on LtL3 (Lt = 2, 4) lattices for the SU(3) deconfining phase transition. We calculate partition function zeros, as well as maximum of the specific heat and of the order parameter susceptibility. Details and warnings are given concerning (i) autocorrelations in computer time and (ii) a reliable extraction of partition function zeros. The finite-size scaling analysis of these data leads to precise results for the critical couplings $\beta$c, for the critical exponent v and for the latent heat $\Delta$S. In both cases (Lt = 2 and 4), the first-order nature of the transition is substantiated. {\textcopyright} 1992.},

abstract = {Ultracold atoms trapped by light offer robust quantum coherence and controllability, providing an attractive system for quantum information processing and for the simulation of complex problems in condensed matter physics. Many quantum information processing schemes require the manipulation and deterministic entanglement of individual qubits; this would typically be accomplished using controlled, state-dependent, coherent interactions among qubits. Recent experiments have made progress towards this goal by demonstrating entanglement among an ensemble of atoms confined in an optical lattice. Until now, however, there has been no demonstration of a key operation: controlled entanglement between atoms in isolated pairs. Here we use an optical lattice of double-well potentials to isolate and manipulate arrays of paired 87Rb atoms, inducing controlled entangling interactions within each pair. Our experiment realizes proposals to use controlled exchange coupling in a system of neutral atoms. Although 87Rb atoms have nearly state-independent interactions, when we force two atoms into the same physical location, the wavefunction exchange symmetry of these identical bosons leads to state-dependent dynamics. We observe repeated interchange of spin between atoms occupying different vibrational levels, with a coherence time of more than ten milliseconds. This observation demonstrates the essential component of a neutral atom quantum SWAP gate (which interchanges the state of two qubits). Its 'half-implementation', the gate, is entangling, and together with single-qubit rotations it forms a set of universal gates for quantum computation. {\textcopyright}2007 Nature Publishing Group.},

@article{Unsal:2012zj,
abstract = {In a Euclidean path integral formulation of gauge theory and quantum mechanics, the $\theta$-term induces a sign problem, and relatedly, a complex phase for the fugacity of topological defects; whereas in Minkowskian formulation, it induces a topological (geometric) phase multiplying ordinary path-amplitudes. In an SU(2) Yang-Mills theory which admits a semi-classical limit, we show that the complex fugacity generates interference between Euclidean path histories, i.e., monopole-instanton events, and radically alters the vacuum structure. At $\theta$=0, a mass gap is due to the monopole-instanton plasma, and the theory has a unique vacuum. At $\theta$=$\pi$, the monopole induced mass gap vanishes, despite the fact that monopole density is independent of $\theta$, due to destructive topological interference. The theory has two options: to remain gapless or to be gapped with a two-fold degenerate vacua. We show the latter is realized by the magnetic bion mechanism, and the two-vacua are realization of spontaneous CP-breaking. The effect of the $\theta$-term in the circle-compactified gauge theory is a generalization of Aharonov-Bohm effect, and the geometric (Berry) phase. As $\theta$ varies from 0 to $\pi$, the gauge theory interpolates between even- and odd-integer spin quantum anti-ferromagnets on two spatial dimensional bi-partite lattices, which have ground state degeneracies one and two, respectively, as it is in gauge theory at $\theta$=0 and $\theta$=$\pi$. {\textcopyright} 2012 American Physical Society.},

abstract = {The essentially nonlinear chiral field in three dimensional space time non-renormalizable in the usual perturbation expansion is studied. We consider systematic 1 N expansion for this model. In the framework of the latter a phase transition takes place: above the critical point the theory is in the O(N) symmetric phase, below it the O(N) symmetry breaks. The 1 N renormalized expansion for both phases is described and the connection between the non-renormalizability of the conventional perturbation theory and the non-analytic dependence on the coupling constant is established. {\textcopyright} 1979.},

abstract = {Perturbation series in quantum field theory (QFT) are generally divergent asymptotic series which are also typically not Borel resummable in the sense that the resummed series is ambiguous. The ambiguity is associated with singularities in the Borel plane on the positive real axis. In quantum mechanics there are cases in which the ambiguity that arises in perturbation theory cancels against a similarly ambiguous contribution from instanton-anti-instanton events. In asymptotically free gauge theories, this mechanism does not suffice because perturbation theory develops ambiguities associated with singularities in the Borel plane which are closer to the origin by a factor of about N (the rank of the gauge group) compared to the singularities realized by instanton events. These are called IR renormalon poles, and on R4 they do not possess any known semiclassical realization. By using continuity on R3×S1, and by generalizing the works of Bogomolny and Zinn-Justin to QFT, we identify saddle point field configurations, e.g., bion-antibion events, corresponding to singularities in the Borel plane which are of order N times closer to the origin than the four-dimensional instanton-anti-instanton singularities in the Borel plane. We conjecture that these are the leading singularities in the Borel plane and that they are the incarnation of the elusive renormalons in the weak coupling regime. {\textcopyright} 2012 American Physical Society.},

abstract = {Instantons of the nonlocal effective action Seff that generates a 1N perturbative expansion for O(N)-symmetric (2)2 theory are obtained for Euclidean spatial dimension 04, through the inverse scattering transformation (IST). They are studied analytically to a large extent. In addition, variational methods are used when the IST does not provide a closed solution for all couplings. The values of the instanton action are given as a function of the coupling constant g for =0, 1, 2, 3, and 4, and 0g+. The large orders of the 1N perturbative expansion are thus estimated. It is found that the 1N perturbation series can be resummed by a Borel transform in integer dimension 03. In four dimensions, the 1N perturbation series is not Borel-summable, owing to the existence of an instanton with real positive action, for physically relevant values of the renormalized coupling constant. It is concluded that (2)2 theory in four dimensions is nonperturbatively unstable. The saddle-point equation of massless (2)2 theory in the 1N expansion is found to be completely integrable at least for spherically symmetric fields. Explicit instanton solutions are given for this case. A large-N estimate of the decay rate of the vacuum is given. {\textcopyright} 1984 The American Physical Society.},

The higher-transient and finite-cutoff effects in Dpreas affect only the adjustable parameters. A precise nonperturbative treatment of the 4 field theory exactly for d=3, in the spirit of the Parisi work, yields nonasymptotic functions of temperature which, including all the quantitative universal characteristics of the critical behavior in Dpreas, are adapted to a suitable comparison with experiments. We emphasize that this work allows a determination, within the experimental accuracy, of the size of Dpreas and an appreciation of the effects of the higher corrections to scaling.

abstract = {We present a lattice-QCD calculation of the B→$\pi$ $\nu$ semileptonic form factors and a new determination of the CKM matrix element |Vub|. We use the MILC asqtad (2+1)-flavor lattice configurations at four lattice spacings and light-quark masses down to 1/20 of the physical strange-quark mass. We extrapolate the lattice form factors to the continuum using staggered chiral perturbation theory in the hard-pion and SU(2) limits. We employ a model-independent z parametrization to extrapolate our lattice form factors from large-recoil momentum to the full kinematic range. We introduce a new functional method to propagate information from the chiral-continuum extrapolation to the z expansion. We present our results together with a complete systematic error budget, including a covariance matrix to enable the combination of our form factors with other lattice-QCD and experimental results. To obtain |Vub|, we simultaneously fit the experimental data for the B→$\pi$ $\nu$ differential decay rate obtained by the BABAR and Belle collaborations together with our lattice form-factor results. We find |Vub|=(3.72±0.16)×10-3, where the error is from the combined fit to lattice plus experiments and includes all sources of uncertainty. Our form-factor results bring the QCD error on |Vub| to the same level as the experimental error. We also provide results for the B→$\pi$ $\nu$ vector and scalar form factors obtained from the combined lattice and experiment fit, which are more precisely determined than from our lattice-QCD calculation alone.

abstract = {The semileptonic decay channel B→D$\tau$$\nu$ is sensitive to the presence of a scalar current, such as that mediated by a charged-Higgs boson. Recently, the BABAR experiment reported the first observation of the exclusive semileptonic decay B→D$\tau$ -$\nu$̄, finding an approximately 2$\sigma$ disagreement with the standard-model prediction for the ratio R(D)=BR(B→D$\tau$$\nu$)/BR(B→$\nu$), where =e,$\mu$. We compute this ratio of branching fractions using hadronic form factors computed in unquenched lattice QCD and obtain R(D)=0.316(12)(7), where the errors are statistical and total systematic, respectively. This result is the first standard-model calculation of R(D) from ab initio full QCD. Its error is smaller than that of previous estimates, primarily due to the reduced uncertainty in the scalar form factor f 0(q2). Our determination of R(D) is approximately 1$\sigma$ higher than previous estimates and, thus, reduces the tension with experiment. We also compute R(D) in models with electrically charged scalar exchange, such as the type-II two-Higgs-doublet model. Once again, our result is consistent with, but approximately 1$\sigma$ higher than, previous estimates for phenomenologically relevant values of the scalar coupling in the type-II model. As a by-product of our calculation, we also present the standard-model prediction for the longitudinal-polarization ratio P L(D)=0.325(4)(3). {\textcopyright} 2012 American Physical Society.},

The value of the critical exponent $\eta$ appears as a parameter of the model and formulas for the critical exponents $\delta$, $\gamma$, $\nu$ are presented.

abstract = {In the presence of a chemical potential, the physics of level crossings leads to singularities at zero temperature, even when the spatial volume is finite. These singularities are smoothed out at a finite temperature but leave behind nontrivial finite size effects which must be understood in order to extract thermodynamic quantities using Monte Carlo methods, particularly close to critical points. We illustrate some of these issues using the classical nonlinear O(2) sigma model with a coupling $\beta$ and chemical potential $\mu$ on a 2+1-dimensional Euclidean lattice. In the conventional formulation this model suffers from a sign problem at nonzero chemical potential and hence cannot be studied with the Wolff cluster algorithm. However, when formulated in terms of the worldline of particles, the sign problem is absent, and the model can be studied efficiently with the "worm algorithm." Using this method we study the finite size effects that arise due to the chemical potential and develop an effective quantum mechanical approach to capture the effects. As a side result we obtain energy levels of up to four particles as a function of the box size and uncover a part of the phase diagram in the ($\beta$,$\mu$) plane. {\textcopyright} 2010 The American Physical Society.},

Here we show the existence and the features of a hierarchy of fractional insulating and conducting states by means of analytical and numerical methods. We demonstrate that the gapped states are characterized by density and magnetic order emerging solely for gases with effective nuclear spin larger than 1/2, whereas the gapless phases can support helical modes. We finally argue that these states are related to an unconventional fractional quantum Hall effect in the thin-torus limit and that their properties can be studied in state-of-the-art laboratories.},

abstract = {We discuss Dyson's argument that the vacuum is unstable under a change g2 g2, in the context of lattice gauge theory. For compact gauge groups, the partition function is well defined at negative g2, but the average plaquette P has a discontinuity when g2 changes sign. This reflects a change of vacuumrather than a loss of vacuum. In addition, P has poles in the complex g2 plane, located at the complex zeros of the partition function (Fisher's zeros). We discuss the relevance of these singularities for lattice perturbation theory. We present new methods to locate Fisher's zeros using numerical values for the density of state in SU(2) and U(1) pure gauge theory. We briefly discuss similar issues for O(N) nonlinear sigma models where the local integrals are also over compact spaces.},

We show that the Calabrese-Cardy conformal field theory predictions for the leading logarithmic scaling of these entropies are consistent with a central charge c=1. This scaling survives the time-continuum limit and truncations of the microscopic degrees of freedom, modifications which allow us to connect the Lagrangian formulation to quantum Hamiltonians. At half-filling, the forms of the subleading corrections imposed by conformal field theory allow the determination of the central charge with an accuracy better than 2{\%} for moderately sized lattices.

If we neglect the plaquette interactions, we generate an effective theory where link variables are integrated out. producing 4-field operators. Plaquette interactions can be restored order by order as in recent calculations with staggered fermions. In the case of a SU(2) gauge theory with fermions, this strong coupling expansion can be related to the strong coupling expansion of Fermi-Hubbard models possibly implementable on optical lattice. We would like to provide a similar construction relating the U{\{}1)-Higgs model to some Bose-Hubbard model.

The properties of the dip are markedly different from those associated with a first order transition and can be understood within a microcanonical finite-size scaling theory for continuous phase transitions.

In order to investigate some features of such approximations, we introduce a linear-renormalization-group transformation appropriate to a system of continuous spins like the Gaussian model of Berlin and Kac. We solve the renormalization-group equations for the Gaussian model exactly, and then study in detail a finite-lattice approximation to the renormalization group for the three-dimensional case. The renormalization-group transformation contains a parameter b. The exact transformation has fixed points only for b=2-52. The approximate transformation has fixed points for a range of values of b around 2-52. Eigenvalues of the transformation, which determine critical exponents, depend on the value of b used in the calculation.

abstract = {Requiring that a Hamiltonian be Hermitian is overly restrictive. A consistent physical theory of quantum mechanics can be built on a complex Hamiltonian that is not Hermitian but satisfies the less restrictive and more physical condition of space-time reflection symmetry ([Formula presented] symmetry). One might expect a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian to lead to a violation of unitarity. However, if [Formula presented] symmetry is not spontaneously broken, it is possible to construct a previously unnoticed symmetry [Formula presented] of the Hamiltonian. Using [Formula presented], an inner product whose associated norm is positive definite can be constructed. The procedure is general and works for any [Formula presented]-symmetric Hamiltonian. Observables exhibit [Formula presented] symmetry, and the dynamics is governed by unitary time evolution. This work is not in conflict with conventional quantum mechanics but is rather a complex generalization of it. {\textcopyright} 2002 The American Physical Society.},

In zero dimensions it was shown that with an appropriate, N-dependent, choice of an optimizing parameter $\lambda$, which is an important feature of the method, the sequence of approximants ZN tends to Z with an error proportional to e-cN. In the present paper we establish the convergence of the linear $\delta$ expansion for the connected vacuum function W=lnZ.

We compare the ideas behind the RG on the one hand and deep machine learning on the other, where depth and scale play a similar role. In order to illustrate this connection, we review a recent numerical method based on the RG---the multiscale entanglement renormalization ansatz (MERA)---and show how it can be converted into a learning algorithm based on a generative hierarchical Bayesian network model. Under the assumption---common in physics---that the distribution to be learned is fully characterized by local correlations, this algorithm involves only explicit evaluation of probabilities, hence doing away with sampling.},

abstract = {We review the use of an exact renormalization group equation in quantum field theory and statistical physics. It describes the dependence of the free energy on an infrared cutoff for the quantum or thermal fluctuations. Non-perturbative solutions follow from approximations to the general form of the coarse-grained free energy or effective average action. They interpolate between the microphysical laws and the complex macroscopic phenomena. Our approach yields a simple unified description for O(N)-symmetric scalar models in two, three or four dimensions, covering in particular the critical phenomena for the second-order phase transitions, including the Kosterlitz-Thouless transition and the critical behavior of polymer chains. We compute the aspects of the critical equation of state which are universal for a large variety of physical systems and establish a direct connection between microphysical and critical quantities for a liquid-gas transition. Universal features of first-order phase transitions are studied in the context of scalar matrix models. We show that the quantitative treatment of coarse graining is essential for a detailed estimate of the nucleation rate. We discuss quantum statistics in thermal equilibrium or thermal quantum field theory with fermions and bosons and we describe the high-temperature symmetry restoration in quantum field theories with spontaneous symmetry breaking. In particular, we explore chiral symmetry breaking and the high-temperature or high-density chiral phase transition in quantum chromodynamics using models with effective four-fermion interactions. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

abstract = {A mathematical model, the spherical model, of a ferromagnet is described. The model is a generalization of the Ising model; and one-, two-, and three-dimensional lattices of infinite extent can be extensively discussed. A three-dimensional lattice shows ferromagnetic behavior and provides a statistical model of the Weiss phenomenological theory. The limiting free energy appears in a form which contains two of the essential features of the exactly known Ising model results in one and two dimensions. This suggests the probable form of the limiting free energy for the three-dimensional Ising model. A simplified model, the Gaussian model, is briefly discussed because this model also contains some of the significant features of the Ising model. However, the Gaussian model, unlike the spherical model, is not defined for all temperatures. {\textcopyright} 1952 The American Physical Society.},

In this paper the first field-theoretic method for numerical simulations of PT-symmetric Hamiltonians is presented. The method is the complex Langevin equation, which was used previously to study complex Hamiltonians in statistical physics and in Minkowski space. We compute the equal-time one- and two-point Green's functions in zero and one dimension, where comparisons to known results can be made. The method should also be applicable in four-dimensional space-time.

Unfortunately, that understanding is confined within the mathematics of differential geometry which has limited its dissemination, especially to the applied communities for which it is particularly important.
In this review I provide a comprehensive conceptual account of these theoretical foundations, focusing on developing a principled intuition behind the method and its optimal implementations rather of any exhaustive rigor. Whether a practitioner or a statistician, the dedicated reader will acquire a solid grasp of how Hamiltonian Monte Carlo works, when it succeeds, and, perhaps most importantly, when it fails.},

These phases feature homogeneous density but periodic modulations of the kinetic hopping energy between nearest or next-nearest neighbors.

abstract = {We consider lattice field theories with topological actions, which are invariant against small deformations of the fields. Some of these actions have infinite barriers separating different topological sectors. Topological actions do not have the correct classical continuum limit and they cannot be treated using perturbation theory, but they still yield the correct quantum continuum limit. To show this, we present analytic studies of the 1-d O(2) and O(3) model, as well as Monte Carlo simulations of the 2-d O(3) model using topological lattice actions. Some topological actions obey and others violate a lattice Schwarz inequality between the action and the topological charge Q. Irrespective of this, in the 2-d O(3) model the topological susceptibility $\chi$t = (Q2)/V is logarithmically divergent in the continuum limit. Still, at non-zero distance the correlator of the topological charge density has a finite continuum limit which is consistent with analytic predictions. Our study shows explicitly that some classically important features of an action are irrelevant for reaching the correct quantum continuum limit. {\textcopyright} 2010 SISSA.},

abstract = {The distribution function P{\textless}inf{\textgreater}L{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}(s) of the local order parameters in finite blocks of linear dimension L is studied for Ising lattices of dimensionality d=2, 3 and 4. Apart from the case where the block is a subsystem of an infinite lattice, also the distribution in finite systems with free [P{\textless}inf{\textgreater}L{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}{\textless}sup{\textgreater}(f){\textless}/sup{\textgreater}(s)] and periodic [P{\textless}inf{\textgreater}L{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}{\textless}sup{\textgreater}(p)(s){\textless}/sup{\textgreater}] boundary conditions is treated. Above the critical point T{\textless}inf{\textgreater}c{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}, these distributions tend for large L towards the same gaussian distribution centered around zero block magnetization, while below T{\textless}inf{\textgreater}c{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} these distributions tend towards two gaussians centered at ±M, where M is the spontaneous magnetization appearing in the infinite systems. However, below T{\textless}inf{\textgreater}c{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} the wings of the distribution at small |s| are distinctly nongaussian, reflecting two-phase coexistence. Hence the distribution functions can be used to obtain the interface tension between ordered phases. At criticality, the distribution functions tend for large L towards scaled universal forms, though dependent on the boundary conditions. These scaling functions are estimated from Monte Carlo simulations. For subsystem-blocks, good agreement with previous renormalization group work of Bruce is obtained. As an application, it is shown that Monte Carlo studies of critical phenomena can be improved in several ways using these distribution functions:(i) standard estimates of order parameter, susceptibility, interface tension are improved (ii) T{\textless}inf{\textgreater}c{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} can be estimated independent of critical exponent estimates (iii) A Monte Carlo "renormalization group" similar to Nightingale's phenomenological renormalization is proposed, which yields fairly accurate exponent estimates with rather moderate effort (iv) Information on coarse-grained hamiltonians can be gained, which is particularly interesting if the method is extended to more general Hamiltonians. {\textcopyright} 1981 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract = {A critical review is given of status and perspectives of Monte Carlo simulations that address bulk and interfacial phase transitions of ferromagnetic Ising models. First, some basic methodological aspects of these simulations are briefly summarized (single-spin flip vs. cluster algorithms, finite-size scaling concepts), and then the application of these techniques to the nearest-neighbor Ising model in d = 3 and 5 dimensions is described, and a detailed comparison to theoretical predictions is made. In addition, the case of Ising models with a large but finite range of interaction and the crossover scaling from mean-field behavior to the Ising universality class are treated. If one considers instead a long-range interaction described by a power-law decay, new classes of critical behavior depending on the exponent of this power law become accessible, and a stringent test of the $\epsilon$-expansion becomes possible. As a final type of crossover from mean-field type behavior to two-dimensional Ising behavior, the interface localization-delocalization transition of Ising films confined between "competing" walls is considered. This problem is still hampered by questions regarding the appropriate coarse-grained model for the fluctuating interface near a wall, which is the starting point for both this problem and the theory of critical wetting. {\textcopyright} 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

abstract = {We indicate how the phase diagrams of lattice gauge theories are easily obtainable through real-space renormalization techniques of the Migdal-Kadanoff transform type. As an illustration, we work out the phase boundaries for an SU(2) single-plaquette action with variable components of spin (the Wilson form), spin 1 [SO(3)], and spin 32. In this three-dimensional space, we study the renormalization flows for the couplings, thereby determining the infrared-stable forms of the action. We discuss their dependence on the phase boundary and their import to the continuum limit of the lattice theory. {\textcopyright} 1982 The American Physical Society.},

These results were obtained from two ensembles generated at physical quark masses (in the isospin limit) with inverse lattice spacings a-1=1.728(4)GeV and 2.358(7) GeV. We are therefore able to perform a continuum extrapolation and hence largely to remove the dominant systematic uncertainty from our earlier results [1,2], that due to lattice artifacts. The only previous lattice computation of K→$\pi$$\pi$ decays at physical kinematics was performed using an ensemble at a single, rather coarse, value of the lattice spacing [a-1≃1.37(1)GeV]. We confirm the observation reported in [3] that there is a significant cancellation between the two dominant contributions to ReA2 which we suggest is an important ingredient in understanding the $\Delta$I=1/2 rule, ReA0/ReA2≃22.5, where the subscript denotes the total isospin of the two-pion final state. Our result for A2 implies that the electroweak penguin contribution to $\epsilon$′/$\epsilon$ is Re($\epsilon$′/$\epsilon$)EWP=-(6.6±1.0)×10-4.},

The ground-state entropy has characteristic features such as a logarithmic divergence with block size and 2kF oscillations that are a hallmark of its Luttinger liquid nature. The interplay between the (extensive) thermal entropy and the ground-state features is studied and we analyze the temperature-induced decay of the amplitude of the oscillations as well as the scaling of the purity. Furthermore, we show how the spin and charge velocities can be extracted from the temperature dependence of the Renyi entropy, bridging our findings to recent experimental proposals on how to implement the measurement of Renyi entropies in the cold atom system. Studying the Renyi mutual information, we also demonstrate how constraints such as particle number conservation can induce persistent correlations visible in the mutual information even at high temperature. {\textcopyright} 2013 American Physical Society.},

abstract = {A large class of classical lattice models describing the coexistence of a finite number of stable states at low temperatures is considered. The dependence of the finite-volume magnetization Mper(h, L) in cubes of size Ldunder periodic boundary conditions on the external field h is analyzed. For the case where two phases coexist at the infinite-volume transition point ht, we prove that, independent of the details of the model, the finite-volume magnetization per lattice site behaves like Mper(ht)+M tanh[MLd(h-ht)] with Mper(h) denoting the infinite-volume magnetization and M=1/2[Mper(ht+0)-Mper(ht-0)]. Introducing the finite-size transition point hm(L) as the point where the finite-volume susceptibility attains the maximum, we show that, in the case of asymmetric field-driven transitions, its shift is ht-hm(L)=O(L-2 d), in contrast to claims in the literature. Starting from the obvious observation that the number of stable phases has a local maximum at the transition point, we propose a new way of determining the point htfrom finite-size data with a shift that is exponentially small in L. Finally, the finite-size effects are discussed also in the case where more than two phases coexist. {\textcopyright} 1990 Plenum Publishing Corporation.},

@article{Boyd:1988,
abstract = {"Domain truncation" is the simple strategy of solving problems on y$\epsilon$ [-∞, ∞] by using a large but finite computational interval, [- L, L] Since u(y) is not a periodic function, spectral methods have usually employed a basis of Chebyshev polynomials, Tn(y/L). In this note, we show that because u(±L) must be very, very small if domain truncation is to succeed, it is always more efficient to apply a Fourier expansion instead. Roughly speaking, it requires about 100 Chebyshev polynomials to achieve the same accuracy as 64 Fourier terms. The Fourier expansion of a rapidly decaying but nonperiodic function on a large interval is also a dramatic illustration of the care that is necessary in applying asymptotic coefficient analysis. The behavior of the Fourier coefficients in the limit n→∞ for fixed interval L is never relevant or significant in this application. {\textcopyright} 1988 Plenum Publishing Corporation.},

Along with the usual open string, one can consider p-adic open strings whose world sheet has as boundary the p-adic line instead (the points on this boundary are labelled by p-adic numbers rather than real numbers). The world sheet itself is then no longer a continous manifold but becomes a discrete homogeneous Bethe lattice, or Bruhat-Tits tree of incidence number p + 1. The p-adic strings thus correspond to specific discretizations of the world sheet. Studying all these discretizations (one for each prime p) together, as suggested by number theory, sheds new light on the ordinary string, via adelic product formulae. One is also led this way to a new type of string, the adelic string. These issues and their generalization to closed strings are discussed after a self-contained mathematical introduction. Other physical systems with natural p-adic counterparts are considered and in their context the connection between p-adic theories and quantum groups is explored. {\textcopyright} 1993.},

We introduce a variant of the original algorithm in which the weight function used in the update does not asymptote to a fixed function, but rather continues to have small fluctuations that enhance tunneling. We formulate a method to evaluate the errors in the density of states, and use the result to calculate the dependence of the average action density and the specific heat on the 't Hooft coupling $\lambda$. This allows us to locate the coupling $\lambda$t at which a strongly first-order transition occurs in the system. For N=20 and 30 we compare our results with those obtained using Ferrenberg-Swendsen multihistogram reweighting and find agreement with errors of 0.2{\%} or less. Extrapolating our results to N=∞, we find ($\lambda$t)-1=0.3148(2).

Furthermore, MCMC methods have enabled the development and use of intricate models in an astonishing array of disciplines as diverse as fisheries science and economics. The wide-ranging practical importance of MCMC has sparked an expansive and deep investigation into fundamental Markov chain theory. The Handbook of Markov Chain Monte Carlo provides a reference for the broad audience of developers and users of MCMC methodology interested in keeping up with cutting-edge theory and applications. The first half of the book covers MCMC foundations, methodology, and algorithms. The second half considers the use of MCMC in a variety of practical applications including in educational research, astrophysics, brain imaging, ecology, and sociology. The in-depth introductory section of the book allows graduate students and practicing scientists new to MCMC to become thoroughly acquainted with the basic theory, algorithms, and applications. The book supplies detailed examples and case studies of realistic scientific problems presenting the diversity of methods used by the wide-ranging MCMC community. Those familiar with MCMC methods will find this book a useful refresher of current theory and recent developments.},

It is argued that such behavior persists even at finite temperatures, probably turning into a sort of crossover for temperatures larger than the temperature of the deconfinement phase transition. We also confirm that the entanglement entropy contains quadratically divergent l-independent term, and that the nondivergent terms behave as l-2 at small distances. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {We carry out a systematic study of entanglement entropy in relativistic quantum field theory. This is defined as the von Neumann entropy SA = -Tr $\rho$Alog$\rho$A corresponding to the reduced density matrix $\rho$A of a subsystem A. For the case of a 1+1-dimensional critical system, whose continuum limit is a conformal field theory with central charge c, we re-derive the result of Holzhey et al when A is a finite interval of length in an infinite system, and extend it to many other cases: finite systems, finite temperatures, and when A consists of an arbitrary number of disjoint intervals. For such a system away from its critical point, when the correlation length $\chi$ is large but finite, we show that SA(c/6)log $\chi$, where is the number of boundary points of A. These results are verified for a free massive field theory, which is also used to confirm a scaling ansatz for the case of finite size off-critical systems, and for integrable lattice models, such as the Ising and XXZ models, which are solvable by corner transfer matrix methods. Finally the free field results are extended to higher dimensions, and used to motivate a scaling form for the singular part of the entanglement entropy near a quantum phase transition. {\textcopyright}2004 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

These results are then used to construct parametric representations of the critical equation of state which are valid in the whole critical regime, satisfy the correct analytic properties (Griffith's analyticity), and take into account the Goldstone singularities at the coexistence curve. A systematic approximation scheme is introduced, which is limited essentially by the number of known terms in the small-field expansion of the effective potential.

In particular, the position of the critical point at filling factor n=1 is found to be at (U t)c =29.34 (2), and the insulating gap $\Delta$ is measured with accuracy of a few percent of the hopping amplitude t. We obtain the effective mass of particle and hole excitations in the insulating state-with explicit demonstration of the emerging particle-hole symmetry and relativistic dispersion law at the transition tip-along with the sound velocity in the strongly correlated superfluid phase. These parameters are the necessary ingredients to perform analytic estimates of the low temperature (T $\Delta$) thermodynamics in macroscopic samples. We present accurate thermodynamic curves, including these for specific heat and entropy, for typical insulating (U t=40) and superfluid (t U=0.0385) phases.

abstract = {Interacting physical systems in the neighborhood of criticality (and massive continuum field theories) can often be characterized by just two physical scales: a (macroscopic) correlation length and a (microscopic) interaction range, related to the coupling and measured by the Ginzburg number G. A critical crossover limit can be defined when both scales become large while their ratio stays finite. The corresponding scaling functions are universal, and they are related to the standard field-theory renormalization-group functions. The critical crossover describes the unique flow from the Gaussian to the nonclassical fixed point.},

abstract = {We study crossover phenomena in a model of self-avoiding walks with medium-range jumps, which corresponds to the limit [formula presented] of an N-vector spin system with medium-range interactions. In particular, we consider the critical crossover limit that interpolates between the Gaussian and the Wilson-Fisher fixed point. The corresponding crossover functions are computed by using field-theoretical methods and an appropriate mean-field expansion. The critical crossover limit is accurately studied by numerical Monte Carlo simulations, which are much more efficient for walk models than for spin systems. Monte Carlo data are compared with the field-theoretical predictions for the critical crossover functions, finding good agreement. We also verify the predictions for the scaling behavior of the leading nonuniversal corrections. We determine phenomenological parametrizations that are exact in the critical crossover limit, have the correct scaling behavior for the leading correction, and describe the nonuniversal crossover behavior of our data for any finite range. {\textcopyright} 2001 The American Physical Society.},

Beginning with a brief review of phase transitions in simple systems and of mean field theory, the text then goes on to introduce the core ideas of the renormalization group. Following chapters cover phase diagrams, fixed points, cross-over behavior, finite-size scaling, perturbative renormalization methods, low-dimensional systems, surface critical behavior, random systems, percolation, polymer statistics, critical dynamics and conformal symmetry. The book closes with an appendix on Gaussian integration, a selected bibliography, and a detailed index. Many problems are included. The emphasis throughout is on providing an elementary and intuitive approach. In particular, the perturbative method introduced leads, among applications, to a simple derivation of the epsilon expansion in which all the actual calculations (at least to lowest order) reduce to simple counting, avoiding the need for Feynman diagrams.},

abstract = {Condensed-matter physics is the study of the collective behaviour of infinitely complex assemblies of electrons, nuclei, magnetic moments, atoms or qubits. This complexity is reflected in the size of the state space, which grows exponentially with the number of particles, reminiscent of the 'curse of dimensionality' commonly encountered in machine learning. Despite this curse, the machine learning community has developed techniques with remarkable abilities to recognize, classify, and characterize complex sets of data. Here, we show that modern machine learning architectures, such as fully connected and convolutional neural networks, can identify phases and phase transitions in a variety of condensed-matter Hamiltonians. Readily programmable through modern software libraries, neural networks can be trained to detect multiple types of order parameter, as well as highly non-trivial states with no conventional order, directly from raw state configurations sampled with Monte Carlo.},

When formulated with a fifth Euclidean dimension, universality arguments suggest that dimensional reduction to four dimensions occurs.

abstract = {We investigate various quantum phase transitions of attractive two-species bosons in a two-dimensional square lattice. Using the algorithm based on the tensor product states, the phase boundaries of the pair-superfluid states with nonzero pair-condensate density and vanishing atomic condensate density are determined. Various quantum phase transitions across the phase boundaries are characterized. Our work thus provides guides to the experimental search of the pair-superfluid phase in lattice boson systems. {\textcopyright} 2010 The American Physical Society.},

abstract = {We introduce a non-perturbative improvement for the renormalization group step scaling function based on the gradient flow running coupling, which may be applied to any lattice gauge theory of interest. Considering first SU(3) gauge theory with Nf = 4 massless staggered fermions, we demonstrate that this improvement can remove O(asup2/sup) lattice artifacts, and thereby increases our control over the continuum extrapolation. Turning to the 12-flavor system, we observe an infrared fixed point in the infinite-volume continuum limit. Applying our proposed improvement reinforces this conclusion by removing all observable O(asup2/sup) effects. For the finite-volume gradient flow renormalization scheme defined by c = √8t/L = 0.2, we find the continuum conformal fixed point to be located at gsup2/sup = 6.2(2).},

abstract = {We study the phase structure of SU(3) lattice gauge theory with N f=12 staggered fermions in the fundamental representation, for both zero and finite temperature at strong gauge couplings. For small fermion masses we find two transitions at finite temperature that converge to two well-separated bulk phase transitions. The phase between the two transitions appears to be a novel phase. We identify order parameters showing that the single-site shift symmetry of staggered fermions is spontaneously broken in this phase. We investigate the eigenvalue spectrum of the Dirac operator, the static potential and the meson spectrum, which collectively establish that this novel phase is confining but chirally symmetric. The phase is bordered by first-order phase transitions, and since we find the same phase structure with N f=8 fermions, we argue that the novel phase is most likely a strong-coupling lattice artifact, the existence of which does not imply IR conformality. {\textcopyright} 2012 American Physical Society.},

abstract = {Abstract: Resurgence theory implies that the non-perturbative (NP) and perturbative (P) data in a QFT are quantitatively related, and that detailed information about non-perturbative saddle point field configurations of path integrals can be extracted from perturbation theory. Traditionally, only stable NP saddle points are considered in QFT, and homotopy group considerations are used to classify them. However, in many QFTs the relevant homotopy groups are trivial, and even when they are non-trivial they leave many NP saddle points undetected. Resurgence provides a refined classification of NP-saddles, going beyond conventional topological considerations. To demonstrate some of these ideas, we study the SU(N) principal chiral model (PCM), a two dimensional asymptotically free matrix field theory which has no instantons, because the relevant homotopy group is trivial. Adiabatic continuity is used to reach a weakly coupled regime where NP effects are calculable. We then use resurgence theory to uncover the existence and role of novel ‘fracton' saddle points, which turn out to be the fractionalized constituents of previously observed unstable ‘uniton' saddle points. The fractons play a crucial role in the physics of the PCM, and are responsible for the dynamically generated mass gap of the theory. Moreover, we show that the fracton-anti-fracton events are the weak coupling realization of 't Hooft's renormalons, and argue that the renormalon ambiguities are systematically cancelled in the semi-classical expansion. Our results motivate the conjecture that the semi-classical expansion of the path integral can be geometrized as a sum over Lefschetz thimbles.},

abstract = {The triviality of the scalar sector of the standard one-doublet Higgs model implies that this model is only an effective low-energy theory valid below some cut-off scale A. For a heavy Higgs this scale must be relatively low (10 TeV or less). Additional interactions coming from the underlying theory, and suppressed by the scale $\Lambda$, give rise to model-dependent corrections to precisely measured electroweak quantities. Dimension six operators arising from the underlying physics naturally contribute to the S and T parameters, and their effects should be included in a global fit to the precision data that determines any limit on the Higgs mass. Using dimensional analysis, we estimate the expected size of these corrections in a custodially-symmetric strongly-interacting underlying theory. Taking these operators' coefficients to be of natural size gives sufficiently large contributions to the T parameter to reconcile Higgs masses as large as 400-500 GeV with the precision data. {\textcopyright} 1999 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.

Our results show evidence of convergence and agreement with simulation results at small Nf. However, contrary to recent simulation results, we do not observe a transition at a critical value of Nf. We further present preliminary results for the chiral condensate of QCD with symmetric or adjoint representation fermions as a function of Nf for Nc = 3. In general, there are sources of error in this approach associated with miscounting of overlapping diagrams, and over-counting of diagrams due to symmetries. These are further elaborated upon in a longer paper.},

Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

The quantum effects on the thermodynamics of the system can be evaluated with quantitative accuracy by a semiclassical method, the pure-quantum self-consistent harmonic approximation, and those of dissipation can be included in the same framework by the Caldeira-Leggett model. Within this scheme, the critical temperature of the superconductor-metal transition, which is a Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless one, can be calculated in an extremely easy way as a function of the quantum coupling and of the dissipation mechanism. Previous quantum Monte Carlo results for the same model appear to be rather inaccurate, while a comparison with experimental data leads us to conclude that the commonly assumed dissipation model is not suitable to describe in detail a real system. {\textcopyright} 2000 The American Physical Society.},

abstract = {The study of open quantum systems - microscopic systems exhibiting quantum coherence that are coupled to their environment - has become increasingly important in the past years, as the ability to control quantum coherence on a single particle level has been developed in a wide variety of physical systems. In quantum optics, the study of open systems goes well beyond understanding the breakdown of quantum coherence. There, the coupling to the environment is sufficiently well understood that it can be manipulated to drive the system into desired quantum states, or to project the system onto known states via feedback in quantum measurements. Many mathematical frameworks have been developed to describe such systems, which for atomic, molecular, and optical (AMO) systems generally provide a very accurate description of the open quantum system on a microscopic level. In recent years, AMO systems including cold atomic and molecular gases and trapped ions have been applied heavily to the study of many-body physics, and it has become important to extend previous understanding of open system dynamics in single- and few-body systems to this many-body context. A key formalism that has already proven very useful in this context is the quantum trajectories technique. This method was developed in quantum optics as a numerical tool for studying dynamics in open quantum systems, and falls within a broader framework of continuous measurement theory as a way to understand the dynamics of large classes of open quantum systems. In this article, we review the progress that has been made in studying open many-body systems in the AMO context, focussing on the application of ideas from quantum optics, and on the implementation and applications of quantum trajectories methods in these systems. Control over dissipative processes promises many further tools to prepare interesting and important states in strongly interacting systems, including the realisation of parameter regimes in quantum simulators that are inaccessible via current techniques. {\textcopyright} 2014 Taylor {\&} Francis.},

We estimate that the fourth-order perturbative prediction reduces the theoretical uncertainty, introduced by the truncation of the series, by 20{\%} with respect to earlier determinations. We discuss to some detail the perturbative prediction of two different methods: fixed-order perturbation theory (FOPT) and contour-improved perturbative theory (CIPT). The corresponding theoretical uncertainties are studied at the $\tau$ and Z mass scales. The CIPT method is found to be more stable with respect to the missing higher order contributions and to renormalization scale variations. It is also shown that FOPT suffers from convergence problems along the complex integration contour. Nonperturbative contributions extracted from the most inclusive fit are small, in agreement with earlier determinations. Systematic effects from quark-hadron duality violation are estimated with simple models and found to be within the quoted systematic errors. The fit based on CIPT gives $\alpha$ S (m $\tau$2 )=0.344±0. 005±0.007, where the first error is experimental and the second theoretical. After evolution to M Z we obtain $\alpha$ S (M Z2 )=0.1212±0.0005±0.0008±0.0005, where the errors are respectively experimental, theoretical and due to the evolution. The result is in agreement with the corresponding N3LO value derived from essentially the Z width in the global electroweak fit. The $\alpha$ S (M Z2 ) determination from $\tau$ decays is the most precise one to date. {\textcopyright} 2008 Springer-Verlag / Societ{\`{a}} Italiana di Fisica.},

Our new analysis uses results from 6 different lattice spacings and 12 different combinations of sea-quark masses to significantly reduce our previous errors. We also correct for finite-lattice-spacing errors in the scale setting, and for nonperturbative chiral corrections to the 22 short-distance quantities from which we extract the coupling. Our final result is $\alpha$V(7.5GeV,nf=3)=0.2120(28), which is equivalent to $\alpha$MS̄(MZ,nf=5)=0.1183(8).

abstract = {For a QCD chiral critical point to exist, the parameter region of small quark masses for which the finite temperature transition is first-order must expand when the chemical potential is turned on. This can be tested by a Taylor expansion of the critical surface (mu,d,ms)c(µ). We present a new method to perform this Taylor expansion numerically, which we first test on an effective model of QCD with static, dense quarks. We then present the results for QCD with 3 degenerate flavors. For a lattice with Nt = 4 time-slices, the first-order region shrinks as the chemical potential is turned on. This implies that, for physical quark masses, the analytic crossover which occurs at µ = 0 between the hadronic and the plasma regimes remains crossover in the µ-region where a Taylor expansion is reliable, i.e. µ T. We present preliminary results from finer lattices indicating that this situation persists, as does the discrepancy between the curvature of Tc(mc(µ = 0),µ) and the experimentally observed freeze-out curve.},

It is however desirable to understand the effect of a finite lattice gauge coupling be on the phase diagram in the $\mu$T plane in order to understand how it evolves into the phase diagram of continuum QCD. Here we discuss how to construct a partition function for non-zero lattice coupling, exact to $\theta$ ($\beta$), and present corresponding Monte Carlo results, in particular for corrections to the chiral susceptibility and to the phase diagram.},

From renormalization group (RG) arguments we obtain the leading scaling exponent, F∼m$\eta$F, for all decay constants of the lowest lying states other than the ones affected by the chiral anomaly and the tensor ones. These scaling relations provide a clear cut way to distinguish a theory with an IRFP from a confining theory with heavy fermions. Moreover, we present a derivation relating the scaling of q̄ ∼m$\eta$q̄q to the scaling of the density of eigenvalues of the massless Dirac operator $\rho$($\lambda$)∼$\lambda$$\eta$q̄q. RG arguments yield $\eta$q̄q=(3-$\gamma$*)/(1+$\gamma$*) as a function of the mass anomalous dimension $\gamma$* at the IRFP. The arguments can be generalized to other condensates such as G2 ∼m 4/(1+$\gamma$*). We describe a heuristic derivation of the result on the condensates, which provides interesting connections between different approaches.

abstract = {The notion of a non-perturbative effect is ambiguous if it requires the subtraction of a perturbative part defined by a diverging series. A common procedure consists in dropping the order of minimal contribution and the higher orders. This allows us to isolate very accurately the one-instanton effect for the double-well potential. For the one plaquette gauge theory, an exact analytical expression can be written for the non-perturbative part. We report recent attempts to extend this approach to the average plaquette of quenched QCD. Our goal is to express the non-perturbative effects in terms of expressions of the form ($\beta$)Be-A$\beta$ calculable semi-classically. The situation is complicated by zeroes of the partition function in the complex $\beta$ plane (presumably near 5.75 ± i0.2). We discuss two methods to describe the intermediate and large order behavior of the perturbative series. One is inspired by mean field theory (logarithmic specific heat) and reproduces accurately the known perturbative series with only two free parameters. A diagrammatic interpretation of this fact is still lacking. The other is based on infra-red renormalons with a factorial growth showing up at order larger than 20 and a possible effective theory interpretation. These extrapolations are compatible with the non-perturbative part of the plaquette being proportional to a4. We propose an exponential parametrization to the corrections to the universal part of the beta function and find results compatible with the suggestion of a2 corrections made by C. Allton.},

We present new methods to infer the existence of these zeros in region of the complex $\beta$ plane where MC reweighting is not reliable. These methods are based on the assumption that the plaquette distribution can be approximated by a $\phi$ 4 type distribution. We give new estimates of the locations for a 44 lattice. For SU (2), we found zeros at $\beta$ = 2.18(1) ± i0.18(2) (which differs from previous estimates), and at $\beta$ = 2.18(1) ± i0.22(2). For SU (3), we confirm $\beta$ = 5.54(2) ± i0.10(2) and found additional zeros at $\beta$ = 5.54(2) ± i0.16(2). Some of the technical material can be found in recent preprints, in the following we emphasize the motivations (why it is important to know the locations of the zeros) and the challenges (why it is difficult to locate the zeros when the volume increases).},

The analysis of the chiral order parameter and the mass spectrum of the theory indicates the restoration of chiral symmetry at zero temperature and the presence of a Coulomb-like phase, depicting a scenario compatible with the existence of an infrared stable fixed point at nonzero coupling.

With a non-improved action we observe a chiral zero-temperature (bulk) transition separating a region at weak coupling, where chiral symmetry is realized, from a region at strong coupling where chiral symmetry is broken. With improved actions, a more complicated pattern emerges, and in particular two first order transitions in the chiral limit appear. We observe that at sufficiently strong coupling the next-to-nearest neighbor terms of the improved lattice action are no longer irrelevant and can indeed modify the pattern observed without improvement. Baryon number conservation can be realized in an unusual way, allowing for an otherwise prohibited oscillating term in the pseudoscalar channel. We discuss the phenomenon by means of explicit examples borrowed from statistical mechanics.

This result is obtained by using a numerical method recently proposed. Only the first three coefficients have been computed analytically. The coefficients grow with the order. We show that this growth is related to the non-convergence of the perturbative expansion due to the infrared renormalon associated to the gluon condensate. This conclusion is based on assuming that the renormalon expansion is expressed in a continuum coupling (e.g. in the MS scheme), taking into account the large perturbative corrections between the continuum and the lattice coupling (up to three loops in MS). To corroborate this conclusion we have computed, with less statistics, the first eight perturbative coefficients for the double plaquette. The coefficients for the elementary and double plaquette grow in a similar way and this is in agreement with the universality of the renormalon singularity. {\textcopyright} 1995.},

abstract = {We investigate theories in which the technifermions in higher dimensional representations of the technicolor gauge group dynamically break the electroweak symmetry of the standard model. Somewhat surprisingly, for the two-index symmetric representation of the gauge group the lowest number of techniflavors needed to render the underlying gauge theory quasiconformal is two. This is exactly one doublet of technifermions with respect to the weak interactions promoting these theories to ideal candidates of walking type technicolor models. From the point of view of the weak interactions the two techniflavor theory has a Witten anomaly, which we cure by introducing a fourth family of leptons. An elegant feature of this model is that the techniquarks resemble an extra family of quarks arranged in the two-index symmetric representation of the SU(2) technicolor theory. We have also studied the theory with three technicolors and two techniflavors in the two-index symmetric representation of the gauge group, which does not require a fourth family of leptons. We confront the models with the recent electroweak precision measurements and demonstrate that the two technicolor theory is a valid candidate for electroweak symmetry breaking via new strong interactions. We investigate different hypercharge assignments for the two color theory and associated fourth family type of leptons. We find that the two technicolor theory is within the 90{\%} confidence level contours defined by the oblique parameters. The electroweak precision measurements provide useful constraints on the relative mass splitting of the new leptons. In the case of a fourth family of leptons with ordinary lepton hypercharge the new heavy neutrino can be a natural candidate of cold dark matter. The mass of this heavy neutrino, constrained by the precision measurements, is slightly larger than the one of the neutral electroweak gauge boson while the charged lepton has a mass roughly twice as large as the associated neutrino. Extensions with a larger value of the hypercharge naturally featuring doubly charged leptons are also favored by precision measurements. We also propose theories in which the critical number of flavors needed to enter the conformal window is higher than the one with fermions in the two-index symmetric representation, but lower than in the walking technicolor theories with fermions only in the fundamental representation of the gauge group. The simplest theories are the ones in which we add a (techni)gluino to the theory, while the rest of the matter fermions remain in the fundamental representation of the gauge group. Although these theories share some features with split supersymmetric theories, they are introduced here to address the hierarchy problem. Because of the near-conformal/chiral phase transition, we show that the composite Higgs is very light compared to the intrinsic scale of the technicolor theory. For the two technicolor theory we predict the composite Higgs mass not to exceed 150 GeV. We also provide estimates for the Higgs mass in walking technicolor theories with fermions in the fundamental representation and show that in this case the mass is around 400 GeV. {\textcopyright} 2005 The American Physical Society.},

The behaviour of this transformation is studied. It has two hyperbolic fixed points for which the existence of a global critical line is proven. The asymptotic behaviour of the transformation is used to prove the existence of the thermodynamic limit in a certain domain in parameter space. Also the existence of a continuum limit for these theories is investigated using informatioin about the asymptotic renomralization behaviour. It turns out that the "trivial" fixed point gives rise to a twoparameter family of continuum limits corresponding to that part of parameter space where the renormalization trajectories originate at this fixed point. Although the model is not very realistic it serves as a simple example of the application of the renormalization group to proving the existence of the thermodynamic limit and the continuum limit of lattice models. Moreover, it illustrates possible complications that can arise in global renormalization group behaviour, and that might also be present in other models where no global analysis of the renormalization transformation has yet been achieved. {\textcopyright} 1991 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract = {The Monte Carlo calculation of R{\'{e}}nyi entanglement entropies Sn of interacting fermions suffers from a well-known signal-to-noise problem, even for a large number of situations in which the infamous sign problem is absent. A few methods have been proposed to overcome this issue, such as ensemble switching and the use of auxiliary partition-function ratios. Here, we present an approach that builds on the recently proposed free-fermion decomposition method; it incorporates entanglement in the probability measure in a natural way; it takes advantage of the hybrid Monte Carlo algorithm (an essential tool in lattice quantum chromodynamics and other gauge theories with dynamical fermions); and it does not suffer from noise problems. This method displays no sign problem for the same cases as other approaches and is therefore useful for a wide variety of systems. As a proof of principle, we calculate S2 for the one-dimensional, half-filled Hubbard model and compare with results from exact diagonalization and the free-fermion decomposition method.},

abstract = {We study the exclusive semileptonic B-meson decays B→K($\pi$) + -, B→K($\pi$)$\nu$$\nu$¯, and B→$\pi$$\tau$$\nu$, computing observables in the Standard Model using the recent lattice-QCD results for the underlying form factors from the Fermilab Lattice and MILC collaborations. These processes provide theoretically clean windows into physics beyond the Standard Model because the hadronic uncertainties are now under good control for suitably binned observables. For example, the resulting partially integrated branching fractions for B→$\pi$$\mu$+$\mu$- and B→K$\mu$+$\mu$- outside the charmonium resonance region are 1-2$\sigma$ higher than the LHCb collaboration's recent measurements, where the theoretical and experimental errors are commensurate. The combined tension is 1.7$\sigma$. Combining the Standard-Model rates with LHCb's measurements yields values for the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) matrix elements |Vtd|=7.45(69)×10-3, |Vts|=35.7(1.5)×10-3, and |Vtd/Vts|=0.201(20), which are compatible with the values obtained from neutral B(s)-meson oscillations and have competitive uncertainties. Alternatively, taking the CKM matrix elements from unitarity, we constrain new-physics contributions at the electroweak scale. The constraints on the Wilson coefficients Re(C9) and Re(C10) from B→$\pi$$\mu$+$\mu$- and B→K$\mu$+$\mu$- are competitive with those from B→K∗$\mu$+$\mu$-, and display a 2.0$\sigma$ tension with the Standard Model. Our predictions for B→K($\pi$)$\nu$$\nu$¯ and B→$\pi$$\tau$$\nu$ are close to the current experimental limits.},

abstract = {This review compares the conceptualization and practice of early real-space renormalization group methods with the conceptualization of more recent real-space transformations based on tensor networks. For specificity, it focuses upon two basic methods: the "potential-moving" approach most used in the period 1975-1980 and the "rewiring method" as it has been developed in the last five years. The newer method, part of a development called the tensor renormalization group, was originally based on principles of quantum entanglement. It is specialized for computing approximations for tensor products constituting, for example, the free energy or the ground state energy of a large system. It can attack a wide variety of problems, including quantum problems, which would otherwise be intractable. The older method is formulated in terms of spin variables and permits a straightforward construction and analysis of fixed points in rather transparent terms. However, in the form described here it is unsystematic, offers no path for improvement, and of unknown reliability. The new method is formulated in terms of index variables which may be considered as linear combinations of the statistical variables. Free energies emerge naturally, but fixed points are more subtle. Further, physical interpretations of the index variables are often elusive due to a gauge symmetry which allows only selected combinations of tensor entries to have physical significance. In applications, both methods employ analyses with varying degrees of complexity. The complexity is parametrized by an integer called $\chi$ (or D in the recent literature). Both methods are examined in action by using them to compute fixed points related to Ising models for small values of the complexity parameter. They behave quite differently. The old method gives a reasonably good picture of the fixed point, as measured, for example, by the accuracy of the measured critical indices. This happens at low values of $\chi$, but there is no known systematic way of getting more accurate results within the old method. In contrast, the rewiring method seems to work poorly in fixed point calculations at low $\chi$. This stands in contrast to the known excellent performance of these newer methods in calculations of free energy, but not fixed points, at large values of $\chi$. Speculations are offered with a particular eye to seeing the reasons why the results of these two approaches are so different. {\textcopyright} 2014 American Physical Society.},

abstract = {Physical interactions in quantum many-body systems are typically local: Individual constituents interact mainly with their few nearest neighbors. This locality of interactions is inherited by a decay of correlation functions, but also reflected by scaling laws of a quite profound quantity: the entanglement entropy of ground states. This entropy of the reduced state of a subregion often merely grows like the boundary area of the subregion, and not like its volume, in sharp contrast with an expected extensive behavior. Such "area laws" for the entanglement entropy and related quantities have received considerable attention in recent years. They emerge in several seemingly unrelated fields, in the context of black hole physics, quantum information science, and quantum many-body physics where they have important implications on the numerical simulation of lattice models. In this Colloquium the current status of area laws in these fields is reviewed. Center stage is taken by rigorous results on lattice models in one and higher spatial dimensions. The differences and similarities between bosonic and fermionic models are stressed, area laws are related to the velocity of information propagation in quantum lattice models, and disordered systems, nonequilibrium situations, and topological entanglement entropies are discussed. These questions are considered in classical and quantum systems, in their ground and thermal states, for a variety of correlation measures. A significant proportion is devoted to the clear and quantitative connection between the entanglement content of states and the possibility of their efficient numerical simulation. Matrix-product states, higher-dimensional analogs, and variational sets from entanglement renormalization are also discussed and the paper is concluded by highlighting the implications of area laws on quantifying the effective degrees of freedom that need to be considered in simulations of quantum states. {\textcopyright} 2010 The American Physical Society.},

abstract = {We reexamine the one-dimensional spin-1 XXZ model with on-site uniaxial single-ion anisotropy as to the appearance and characterization of the symmetry-protected topological Haldane phase. By means of large-scale density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG) calculations the central charge can be determined numerically via the von Neumann entropy, from which the ground-state phase diagram of the model can be derived with high precision. The nontrivial gapped Haldane phase shows up in between the trivial gapped even Haldane and N{\'{e}}el phases, appearing at large single-ion and spin-exchange interaction anisotropies, respectively. We furthermore carve out a characteristic degeneracy of the lowest entanglement level in the topological Haldane phase, which is determined using a conventional finite-system DMRG technique with both periodic and open boundary conditions. Defining the spin and neutral gaps in analogy to the single-particle and neutral gaps in the intimately connected extended Bose-Hubbard model, we show that the excitation gaps in the spin model qualitatively behave just as for the bosonic system. We finally compute the dynamical spin structure factor in the three different gapped phases and find significant differences in the intensity maximum which might be used to distinguish these phases experimentally.},

abstract = {We comment on the Lee-Yang zero analysis for the study of the phase structure of QCD at high temperature and baryon number density by Monte-Carlo simulations. We find that the sign problem for nonzero density QCD induces a serious problem in the finite volume scaling analysis of the Lee-Yang zeros for the investigation of the order of the phase transition. If the sign problem occurs at large volume, the Lee-Yang zeros will always approach the real axis of the complex parameter plane in the thermodynamic limit. This implies that a scaling behavior which would suggest a crossover transition will not be obtained. To clarify this problem, we discuss the Lee-Yang zero analysis for SU(3) pure gauge theory as a simple example without the sign problem, and then consider the case of nonzero density QCD. It is suggested that the distribution of the Lee-Yang zeros in the complex parameter space obtained by each simulation could be more important information for the investigation of the critical endpoint in the (T,$\mu$q) plane than the finite volume scaling behavior. {\textcopyright} 2006 The American Physical Society.},

abstract = {Correlation functions play an important role for the theoretical and experimental characterization of many-body systems. In solid-state systems, they are usually determined through scattering experiments, whereas in cold gases systems, time-of-flight, and in situ absorption imaging are the standard observation techniques. However, none of these methods allow the in situ detection of spatially resolved correlation functions at the single-particle level. Here, we give a more detailed account of recent advances in the detection of correlation functions using in situ fluorescence imaging of ultracold bosonic atoms in an optical lattice. This method yields single-site- and single-atom-resolved images of the lattice gas in a single experimental run, thus gaining direct access to fluctuations in the many-body system. As a consequence, the detection of correlation functions between an arbitrary set of lattice sites is possible. This enables not only the detection of two-site correlation functions but also the evaluation of non-local correlations, which originate from an extended region of the system and are used for the characterization of quantum phases that do not possess (quasi-)long-range order in the traditional sense. {\textcopyright} 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

The curious finite size dependence of the peak maximum is explained from the interplay of the crossover phenomenon with the deconfinement transition occurring due to the finite extension of the lattice. We find, that for lattices of size 84 and larger the crossover peak is independent of lattice size at $\beta$co = 2.23(2) and has a peak height of CV,co = 1.685(10). We conclude therefore that the crossover peak is not the result of an ordinary phase transition. Further, the contributions to Cv from different plaquette correlations are calculated. We find, that at the peak and far outside the peak the ratio of contributions from orthogonal and parallel plaquette correlations is different. To estimate the finite temperature influence on symmetric lattices even far off the deconfinement transition point we calculate the modulus of the lattice average of the Polyakov loop on these lattices and compare it to predictions from a random walk model.},

abstract = {The optimal reconstruction of cosmic metric perturbations and other signals requires knowledge of their power spectra and other parameters. If these are not known a priori, they have to be measured simultaneously from the same data used for the signal reconstruction. We formulate the general problem of signal inference in the presence of unknown parameters within the framework of information field theory. To solve this, we develop a generic parameter-uncertainty renormalized estimation (PURE) technique. As a concrete application, we address the problem of reconstructing Gaussian signals with unknown power-spectrum with five different approaches: (i)separate maximum-a-posteriori power-spectrum measurement and subsequent reconstruction, (ii)maximum-a-posteriori reconstruction with marginalized power-spectrum, (iii)maximizing the joint posterior of signal and spectrum, (iv)guessing the spectrum from the variance in the Wiener-filter map, and (v)renormalization flow analysis of the field-theoretical problem providing the PURE filter. In all cases, the reconstruction can be described or approximated as Wiener-filter operations with assumed signal spectra derived from the data according to the same recipe, but with differing coefficients. All of these filters, except the renormalized one, exhibit a perception threshold in case of a Jeffreys prior for the unknown spectrum. Data modes with variance below this threshold do not affect the signal reconstruction at all. Filter (iv) seems to be similar to the so-called Karhune-Lo{\`{e}}ve and Feldman-Kaiser-Peacock estimators for galaxy power spectra used in cosmology, which therefore should also exhibit a marginal perception threshold if correctly implemented. We present statistical performance tests and show that the PURE filter is superior to the others, especially if the post-Wiener-filter corrections are included or in case an additional scale-independent spectral smoothness prior can be adopted. {\textcopyright} 2011 American Physical Society.},

It was conjectured that small increases in the up and down quark masses can move QCD to the critical trajectory for an infrared limit cycle in the three-nucleon system. At the critical quark masses, the binding energies of the deuteron and its spin-singlet partner are tuned to zero and the triton has infinitely many excited states with an accumulation point at the three-nucleon threshold. We exemplify three parameter sets where this effect occurs at next-to-leading order in the chiral counting. For one of them, we study the structure of the three-nucleon system in detail using both chiral and contact effective field theories. Furthermore, we investigate the matching of the chiral and contact theories in the critical region and calculate the influence of the limit cycle on three-nucleon scattering observables. {\textcopyright} Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2006.},

Using quantum gases in optical lattices, superfluids can be realized over a wide range of tunable parameters, with a continuous connection to the regime of strong correlation. However, for full experimental access and a comprehensive comparison with condensed-matter systems, there is a need for new detection techniques to probe their essential physics. Here we report on a comprehensive study of superfluids in optical lattices by Bragg spectroscopy. We present fully momentum-resolved measurements of the band structure and associated interaction effects at several lattice depths. In addition, we directly study the composition of excitations and observe strong indications for Bogoliubov backscattering. Our measurements demonstrate the applicability and limits of the Bogoliubov theory to describe excitation properties of superfluids in periodic potentials and should pave the way for detailed studies of strongly correlated phases. {\textcopyright} 2010 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

Among other results, it is shown that for fixed $\tau$=n(T-Tc)Tc, the specific heat per spin of a large lattice is given by Cmn(T)kBmn=A0lnn+B($\tau$,$\xi$)+B1($\tau$)(lnn)n+B2($\tau$,$\xi$)n+O[(lnn)3n2], where explicit expressions can be given for A0 and for the functions B, B1, and B2. It follows that the specific-heat peak of the finite lattice is rounded on a scale $\delta$=$\Delta$TTc∼1n, while the maximum in Cmn(T) is displaced from Tc by $\epsilon$=(Tc-Tmax)Tc∼1n. For $\xi$0{\textgreater}$\xi${\textgreater}$\xi$0-1, where $\xi$0=3.13927, the maximum lies above Tc; but for $\xi${\textgreater}$\xi$0 or $\xi${\textless}$\xi$0-1, the maximum is depressed below Tc; when $\xi$=,$\xi$0,or$\xi$0-1, the relative shift in the maximum from Tc is only of order (lnn)n2.

abstract = {The phase diagrams and phase transitions of bosons with short-ranged repulsive interactions moving in periodic and/or random external potentials at zero temperature are investigated with emphasis on the superfluid-insulator transition induced by varying a parameter such as the density. Bosons in periodic potentials (e.g., on a lattice) at T=0 exhibit two types of phases: a superfluid phase and Mott insulating phases characterized by integer (or commensurate) boson densities, by the existence of a gap for particle-hole excitations, and by zero compressibility. Generically, the superfluid onset transition in d dimensions from a Mott insulator to superfluidity is ideal, or mean field in character, but at special multicritical points with particle-hole symmetry it is in the universality class of the (d+1)-dimensional XY model. In the presence of disorder, a third, Bose glass phase exists. This phase is insulating because of the localization effects of the randomness and analogous to the Fermi glass phase of interacting fermions in a strongly disordered potential. The Bose glass phase is characterized by a finite compressibility, no gap, but an infinite superfluid susceptibility. In the presence of disorder the transition to superfluidity is argued to occur only from the Bose glass phase, and never directly from the Mott insulator. This zero-temperature superfluid-insulator transition is studied via generalizations of the Josephson scaling relation for the superfluid density at the ordinary transition, highlighting the crucial role of quantum fluctuations. The transition is found to have a dynamic critical exponent z exactly equal to d and correlation length and order-parameter correlation exponents and which satisfy the bounds 2/d and 2-d, respectively. It is argued that the superfluid-insulator transition in the presence of disorder may have an upper critical dimension dc which is infinite, but a perturbative renormalization-group calculation wherein the critical exponents have mean-field values for weak disorder above d=4 is also discussed. Many of these conclusions are verified by explicit calculations on a model of one-dimensional bosons in the presence of both random and periodic potentials. The general results are applied to experiments on He4 absorbed in porous media such as Vycor. Some measurable properties of the superfluid onset are predicted exactly [e.g., the exponent x relating the transition temperature to the zero-temperature superfluid density is found to be d/2(d-1)], while stringent bounds are placed on others. Analysis of preliminary data is consistent with these predictions. {\textcopyright} 1989 The American Physical Society.},

We use the (2+1)-flavor gauge-field ensembles generated by the RBC and UKQCD collaborations with the domain-wall fermion action and Iwasaki gauge action. For the b-quarks we use the anisotropic clover action with a relativistic heavy-quark interpretation. We analyze data at two lattice spacings of a≈0.11, 0.086 fm with unitary pion masses as light as M$\pi$≈290MeV. We simultaneously extrapolate our numerical results to the physical light-quark masses and to the continuum and interpolate in the pion/kaon energy using SU(2) "hard-pion" chiral perturbation theory for heavy-light meson form factors. We provide complete systematic error budgets for the vector and scalar form factors f+(q2) and f0(q2) for both B→$\pi$ $\nu$ and Bs→K $\nu$ at three momenta that span the q2 range accessible in our numerical simulations. Next we extrapolate these results to q2=0 using a model-independent z-parametrization based on analyticity and unitarity. We present our final results for f+(q2) and f0(q2) as the coefficients of the series in z and the matrix of correlations between them; this provides a parametrization of the form factors valid over the entire allowed kinematic range. Our results agree with other three-flavor lattice-QCD determinations using staggered light quarks, and have comparable precision, thereby providing important independent cross-checks. Both B→$\pi$ $\nu$ and Bs→K $\nu$ decays enable determinations of the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa matrix element |Vub|. To illustrate this, we perform a combined z-fit of our numerical B→$\pi$ $\nu$ form-factor data with the experimental measurements of the branching fraction from BABAR and Belle leaving the relative normalization as a free parameter; we obtain |Vub|=3.61(32)×10-3, where the error includes statistical and all systematic uncertainties. The same approach can be applied to the decay Bs→K $\nu$ to provide an alternative determination of |Vub| once the process has been measured experimentally. Finally, in anticipation of future experimental measurements, we make predictions for B→$\pi$ $\nu$ and Bs→K $\nu$ differential branching fractions and forward-backward asymmetries in the Standard Model.},

With twelve massless fermions in the fundamental representation of the SU(3) color gauge group, an infrared fixed point (IRFP) of the $\beta$-function was recently reported in the theory [A. Cheng, A. Hasenfratz, Y. Liu, G. Petropoulos, and D. Schaich, J. High Energy Phys. 05 (2014) 137] with uncertainty in the location of the critical gauge coupling inside the narrow [6.0{\textless}g∗2{\textless}6.4] interval and widely accepted since as the strongest evidence for a conformal fixed point and scale invariance in the theory with model-building implications. Using the exact same renormalization scheme as the previous study, we show that no fixed point of the $\beta$-function exists in the reported interval. Our findings eliminate the only seemingly credible evidence for conformal fixed point and scale invariance in the Nf=12 model whose infrared properties remain unresolved. The implications of the recently completed 5-loop QCD $\beta$-function for arbitrary flavor number are discussed with respect to our work.},

Extending previous studies we outline our strategy as we investigate Goldstone dynamics and Electroweak scale setting from chiral symmetry breaking ($\chi$SB), test the GMOR relation from the spectrum of the Dirac operator and the related chiral condensate, begin to develop and test mixed action based improved analysis of $\chi$SB with new run plans at fixed topology to cross over from the p-regime to the epsilon-regime of $\chi$SB, continue to pursue the light 0++ scalar and its relation to the dilaton, and probe the scale-dependent running coupling from the perturbative UV scale to the scale of chiral symmetry breaking. Our observations suggest that the model is very close to the conformal window and a light composite scalar, perhaps the Higgs impostor with or without dilaton-like interpretation, appears to emerge with 0++ quantum numbers. The lightest baryon of the model on the 3 TeV scale has intriguing implications.},

abstract = {We report new results on nearly conformal gauge theories with fermions in the fundamental representation of the SU (3) color gauge group as the number of fermion flavors is varied in the Nf = 4 - 16 range. To unambiguously identify the chirally broken phase below the conformal window we apply a comprehensive lattice tool set in finite volumes which includes the test of Goldstone pion dynamics, the spectrum of the fermion Dirac operator, and eigenvalue distributions of random matrix theory. We also discuss the theory inside the conformal window and present our first results on the running of the renormalized gauge coupling and the renormalization group beta function. The importance of understanding finite volume zero momentum gauge field dynamics inside the conformal window is illustrated.

abstract = {We report new results for a frequently discussed gauge theory with twelve fermion flavors in the fundamental representation of the SU(3) color gauge group. The model, controversial with respect to its conformality, is important in non-perturbative studies searching for a viable composite Higgs mechanism beyond the Standard Model (BSM). In comparison with earlier work, our new simulations apply larger volumes and probe deeper in fermion and pion masses toward the chiral limit. Investigating the controversy, we subject the model to opposite hypotheses with respect to the conformal window. In the first hypothesis, below the conformal window, we test chiral symmetry breaking ($\chi$SB) with its Goldstone spectrum, F$\pi$, the $\chi$SB condensate, and several composite hadron states as analytic functions of the fermion mass when varied in a limited range with our best effort to control finite volume effects. In the second test, for the alternate hypothesis inside the conformal window, we probe conformal behavior driven by a single anomalous mass dimension under the assumption of unbroken chiral symmetry at vanishing fermion mass. Our results at fixed gauge coupling, based on the assumptions of the two hypotheses we define, show low level of confidence in the conformal scenario with leading order scaling analysis. Relaxing the important assumption of leading mass-deformed conformality with its conformal finite size scaling would require added theoretical understanding of the scaling violation terms in the conformal analysis and a comprehensive test of its effects on the confidence level of the fits. Results for the running coupling, based on the force between static sources, and preliminary indications for the finite temperature transition are also presented. Staggered lattice fermions with stout-suppressed taste breaking are used throughout the simulations. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Machine learning has been a fast growing field of research in several areas dealing with large datasets. We report recent attempts to use renormalization group (RG) ideas in the context of machine learning. We examine coarse graining procedures for perceptron models designed to identify the digits of the MNIST data. We discuss the correspondence between principal components analysis (PCA) and RG flows across the transition for worm configurations of the 2D Ising model. Preliminary results regarding the logarithmic divergence of the leading PCA eigenvalue were presented at the conference. More generally, we discuss the relationship between PCA and observables in Monte Carlo simulations and the possibility of reducing the number of learning parameters in supervised learning based on RG inspired hierarchical ansatzes.},

Here we study the quantum dynamics of a deterministically created spin-impurity atom, as it propagates in a one-dimensional lattice system. We probe the spatial probability distribution of the impurity at different times using single-site-resolved imaging of bosonic atoms in an optical lattice. In the Mott-insulating regime, the quantum-coherent propagation of a magnetic excitation in the Heisenberg model can be observed using a post-selection technique. Extending the study to the superfluid regime of the bath, we quantitatively determine how the bath affects the motion of the impurity, showing evidence of polaronic behaviour. The experimental data agree with theoretical predictions, allowing us to determine the effect of temperature on the impurity motion.

Using finite size scaling theory, we obtain $\omega$≡$\gamma$/$\nu$=1.93±0.03 for N$\tau$=4 , in excellent agreement with universality. Corresponding determinations for the N$\tau$=5 and 6 lattices are also found to be in very good agreement with this estimate. The critical couplings for N$\tau$=4 , 5, 6 and 8 lattices exhibit large shifts towards the strong coupling region when compared with the usual Wilson action, and suggest a lot smoother approach to scaling. {\textcopyright} 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.},

It is based on a combination of renormalization group ideas, the Markov random field modeling of images, and Metropolis-type Monte Carlo algorithms. The method is efficiently implementable on parallel architectures, and provides a unifying procedure for performing a hierarchical, multiscale, coarse-to-fine analysis of image processing tasks such as restoration, texture analysis, coding, motion analysis, etc. In this paper we formulate the method and apply it to the restoration of degraded images. The restoration algorithm is a new global optimization algorithm applicable to other optimization problems. It generates iteratively a multilevel cascade of restored images corresponding to different levels of resolution, or scale. In the lower levels of the cascade appear the large scale features of the image, and in the higher levels, the “microscopic” features of the image. The quality of restoration, in our computer experiments, has been remarkable. {\textcopyright} 1989 IEEE},

By including auxiliary bosons in the simulation, we show how the Abelian-Higgs Hamiltonian emerges effectively. We analyze the accuracy of our method in terms of different experimental parameters, as well as the effect of the finite number of bosons on the quantum simulator. Finally, we propose possible experiments for studying the ground state of the system in different regimes of the theory, and measuring interesting high energy physics phenomena in real time.},

The theorems thus obtained provide a simple proof of the existence of "bulk" values for 〈$\sigma$k$\sigma$ l〉 and for 〈$\sigma$k〉; the latter is identical with the usual bulk magnetization per spin. The correlation functions 〈$\sigma$k$\sigma$l〉 are monotone nondecreasing in |H| for fixed temperature T. Both 〈$\sigma$k$\sigma$ l〉 and 〈$\sigma$k〉 (and thus the bulk magnetization) are monotone nonincreasing in T for fixed H ≥ 0.},

Ultracold atoms in optical lattices represent an ideal platform for simulations of quantum many-body problems.

Ultracold atom-based quantum simulators have already been used to probe quantum magnetism, to realize and detect topological quantum matter, and to study quantum systems with controlled long-range interactions. Experiments on many-body systems out of equilibrium have also provided results in regimes unavailable to the most advanced supercomputers.

The starting point is the five-loop perturbative expansion of the effective potential (or free energy) in the framework of renormalized $\Phi$43 field theory. The 3D perturbative expansion is summed, using a Borel transformation and a mapping based on large order behaviour results. It is known that the equation of state has parametric representations which incorporate in a simple way its scaling and regularity properties. We show that such a representation can be used to accurately determine it from the knowledge of the few first coefficients of the expansion for small magnetization. Revised values of amplitude ratios are deduced. Finally we compare the 3D values with the results obtained by the same method from the $\epsilon$ = 4 - d expansion. {\textcopyright} 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.},

Here we demonstrate single-site- and single-atom-resolved fluorescence imaging of fermionic potassium-40 atoms in a quantum-gas microscope set-up, using electromagnetically-induced-transparency cooling. We detected on average 1,000 fluorescence photons from a single atom within 1.5 s, while keeping it close to the vibrational ground state of the optical lattice. A quantum simulator for fermions with single-particle access will be an excellent test bed to investigate phenomena and properties of strongly correlated fermionic quantum systems, allowing direct measurement of ordered quantum phases and out-of-equilibrium dynamics, with access to quantities ranging from spin-spin correlation functions to many-particle entanglement.},

abstract = {To leading order in perturbation theory, we solve QCD, defined on a small three sphere in the large N and Nf limit, at finite chemical potential and map out the phase diagram in the ($\mu$, T) plane. The action of QCD is complex in the presence of a non-zero quark chemical potential which results in the sign problem for lattice simulations. In the large N theory, which at low temperatures becomes a conventional unitary matrix model with a complex action, we find that the dominant contribution to the functional integral comes from complexified gauge field configurations. For this reason the eigenvalues of the Polyakov line lie off the unit circle on a contour in the complex plane. We find at low temperatures that as $\mu$ passes one of the quark energy levels there is a third-order Gross-Witten transition from a confined to a deconfined phase and back again giving rise to a rich phase structure. We compare a range of physical observables in the large N theory to those calculated numerically in the theory with N = 3. In the latter case there are no genuine phase transitions in a finite volume but nevertheless the observables are remarkably similar to the large N theory. {\textcopyright} SISSA 2010.},

We calculate several observables including the Polyakov lines and the quark number, for large number of colors N and large number of quark flavors Nf , on S1 ×S3, and compare with results for the same system with N = 3, and with results for N = 2 lattice QCD. For N {\textgreater} 2 the action is complex and the dominant contributions to the path integral occur in the space of complexified gauge field configurations. This results in the expectation values of the eigenvalues of the Polyakov line lying off the unit circle and out in the complex plane.

This work serves to test the method and I study relatively well understood systems: the Nf=0, 4 and 16 flavor models. The pure gauge and Nf=4 systems are confining and chirally broken and the MCRG method can predict their bare step scaling functions.

The low-dimensional manifolds on which the digits lie are modeled by long ravines in the free-energy landscape of the top-level associative memory, and it is easy to explore these ravines by using the directed connections to display what the associative memory has in mind. {\textcopyright} 2006 Massachusetts Institute of Technology.},

abstract = {Hamiltonian Monte Carlo is a powerful algorithm for sampling from difficult-to-normalize posterior distributions. However, when the geometry of the posterior is unfavorable, it may take many expensive evaluations of the target distribution and its gradient to converge and mix. We propose neural transport (NeuTra) HMC, a technique for learning to correct this sort of unfavorable geometry using inverse autoregressive flows (IAF), a powerful neural variational inference technique. The IAF is trained to minimize the KL divergence from an isotropic Gaussian to the warped posterior, and then HMC sampling is performed in the warped space. We evaluate NeuTra HMC on a variety of synthetic and real problems, and find that it significantly outperforms vanilla HMC both in time to reach the stationary distribution and asymptotic effective-sample-size rates.},

We find that quantified principal components from PCA not only allow the exploration of different phases and symmetry-breaking, but they can distinguish phase-transition types and locate critical points. We show that the corresponding weight vectors have a clear physical interpretation, which is particularly interesting in the frustrated models such as the triangular antiferromagnet, where they can point to incipient orders. Unlike the other well-studied models, the properties of the BSI model are less well known. Using both PCA and conventional Monte Carlo analysis, we demonstrate that the BSI model shows an absence of phase transition and macroscopic ground-state degeneracy. The failure to capture the "charge" correlations (vorticity) in the BSI model (XY model) from raw spin configurations points to some of the limitations of PCA. Finally, we employ a nonlinear unsupervised machine learning procedure, the "autoencoder method," and we demonstrate that it too can be trained to capture phase transitions and critical points.},

The Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) phase transition in two-dimensional Bose gases presents a particularly interesting case because the marginal dimensionality and intrinsic scaling symmetry result in a broad fluctuation regime and an extended range of universal scaling behaviour. Studies of the BKT transition in cold atoms have stimulated great interest in recent years, but a clear demonstration of critical behaviour near the phase transition has remained elusive. Here we report in situ density and density-fluctuation measurements of two-dimensional Bose gases of caesium at different temperatures and interaction strengths, observing scale-invariant, universal behaviours. The extracted thermodynamic functions confirm the existence of a wide universal region near the BKT phase transition, and provide a sensitive test of the universality predicted by classical-field theory and quantum Monte Carlo calculations. Our experimental results provide evidence for growing density-density correlations in the fluctuation region, and call for further explorations of universal phenomena in classical and quantum critical physics. {\textcopyright} 2011 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

abstract = {Training Deep Neural Networks is complicated by the fact that the distribution of each layer's inputs changes during training, as the parameters of the previous layers change. This slows down the training by requiring lower learning rates and careful parameter initialization, and makes it notoriously hard to train models with saturating nonlinearities. We refer to this phenomenon as internal covariate shift, and address the problem by normalizing layer inputs. Our method draws its strength from making normalization a part of the model architecture and performing the normalization for each training mini-batch. Batch Normalization allows us to use much higher learning rates and be less careful about initialization, and in some cases eliminates the need for Dropout. Applied to a state-of-the-art image classification model, Batch Normalization achieves the same accuracy with 14 times fewer training steps, and beats the original model by a significant margin. Using an ensemble of batch-normalized networks, we improve upon the best published result on ImageNet classification: reaching 4.82{\%} top-5 test error, exceeding the accuracy of human raters.},

abstract = {The OZI rule is prominent in hadronic phenomena only because OZI violation is typically an order of magnitude smaller than expected from large N{\_}c arguments. With its standard {\^{}}3P{\_}0 pair creation operator for hadronic decays by flux tube breaking, the quark model respects the OZI rule at tree level and exhibits the cancellations between OZI-violating meson loop diagrams required for this dramatic suppression. However, if the quark model explanation for these cancellations is correct, then OZI violation would be expected to be large in the nonet with the same quantum numbers as the pair creation operator: the 0{\^{}}{\{}++{\}} mesons. Experiment is currently unable to identify these mesons, but we report here on a lattice QCD calculation which confirms that the OZI rule arises from QCD in the vector and axial vector mesons as observed, and finds a large violation of the rule in the scalar mesons as anticipated by the quark model. In view of this result, we make some remarks on possible connections between the {\^{}}3P{\_}0 pair creation model, scalar mesons, and the U{\_}A(1) anomaly responsible for the large OZI violation which drives the $\backslash$eta' mass. In particular, we note that our result favors the large N{\_}c and not the instanton interpretation of the solution to the $\backslash$eta' mass problem.},

abstract = {A quantum simulator is a well-controlled quantum system that can follow the evolution of a prescribed model whose behaviour may be difficult to determine. A good example is the simulation of a set of interacting spins, where phase transitions between various spin orders can underlie poorly understood concepts such as spin liquids. Here we simulate the emergence of magnetism by implementing a fully connected non-uniform ferromagnetic quantum Ising model using up to 9 trapped 171Yb+ ions. By increasing the Ising coupling strengths compared with the transverse field, the crossover from paramagnetism to ferromagnetic order sharpens as the system is scaled up, prefacing the expected quantum phase transition in the thermodynamic limit. We measure scalable order parameters appropriate for large systems, such as various moments of the magnetization. As the results are theoretically tractable, this work provides a critical benchmark for the simulation of intractable arbitrary fully connected Ising models in larger systems. {\textcopyright} 2011 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

abstract = {Frustration, or the competition between interacting components of a network, is often responsible for the emergent complexity of many-body systems. For instance, frustrated magnetism is a hallmark of poorly understood systems such as quantum spin liquids, spin glasses, and spin ices, whose ground states can be massively degenerate and carry high degrees of quantum entanglement. Here, we engineer frustrated antiferromagnetic interactions between spins stored in a crystal of up to 16 trapped 171Yb+ atoms. We control the amount of frustration by continuously tuning the range of interaction and directly measure spin correlation functions and their coherent dynamics. This prototypical quantum simulation points the way toward a new probe of frustrated quantum magnetism and perhaps the design of new quantum materials.},

It can be a continuous stochastic process such as the Wiener process, or a continuum approximation of a discrete random walk. In the last lecture, we considered the cases when the operator L is independent of time (for example, D � 2), and derived a hiearchy of PDEs for the function g n (x|x 0). In particular, we have the following PDE for g 0 : t L g 0 = − $\delta$(x − x 0) , where g 0 (x|x 0) = 0 $\rho$(x, t|x 0) dt (2) Suppose we have an absorbing boundary A, if we are interested in the location of the first passage on A, but do not care about the first passage time, the eventual hitting PDF E(x) can be obtained as the flux on boundary as follows: E(x) = {\textperiodcentered} M $\rho$, x ∈ A (3) We discussed this eventual hitting probability briefly and talked about the electrostatic analogy last time. In this lecture, we are going to discuss general techniques of calculating E(x) by using complex analysis. 2 Conformal Invariance: General Principle We now introduce the notion of conformal mapping. A conformal mapping defined by y � = f (� x) can be viewed as a map that performs a local stretching and rotation on � x. The angle between any intersecting curves is preserved under conformal mapping. For example, curves through x � 0 which are tangent to each other are mapped onto curves with a common tangent at y � 0 .},

The latent heat at the deconfining transition is estimated both by a direct measurement of the gap on the spatially large lattices and by applying a finite-size scaling law. The results obtained by these two independent methods are remarkably consistent with each other on both the Nt=4 lattices. The latent heat for Nt=6 is much smaller than that for Nt=4 and is about of the Stefan-Boltzmann value 8215.

The lattice is obtained from the 4D surface of the 5D cubic lattice by its radial projection onto a 4D sphere, and made homogeneous by means of appropriate weight factors for individual plaquette contributions to the action. On such lattices the two-state signal, impeding the studies of this theory on toroidal lattices, is absent for $\gamma${\textless}˜0. Furthermore, here a consistent finite-size scaling behavior of several bulk observables is found, with the correlation length exponent $\nu$ in the range $\nu$=0.35-0.40. These observables include Fisher zeros, specific-heat, and cumulant extrema as well as pseudocritical values of $\beta$ at fixed $\gamma$. The most reliable determination of $\nu$ by means of the Fisher zeros gives $\nu$=0.365(8). The phase transition at $\gamma${\textless}˜0 is thus very probably of second order and belongs to the universality class of a non-Gaussian fixed point. {\textcopyright} 1996 The American Physical Society.},

The main signature of DSI is the presence of log-periodic oscillations correcting the usual power laws, corresponding to complex exponents. Log-periodic structures are important because they reveal the presence of preferred scaling ratios of the underlying physical processes. Here we present evidence of log periodicity overlaying the leading power-law behavior of probability density distributions of affine random maps with parametric noise. The log periodicity is due to intermittent amplifying multiplicative events. We quantify precisely the progressive smoothing of the log-periodic structures as the randomness increases and find a large robustness. Our results provide useful markers for the search of log periodicity in numerical and experimental data. {\textcopyright} 1998 The American Physical Society.},

We find a region of parameter space with large Holstein coupling where the fermion sign recovers despite large values of the Hubbard interaction. This indicates that studies of correlated polarons at finite carrier concentrations are likely accessible to DQMC simulations. We then restrict ourselves to the half-filled model and examine the evolution of the antiferromagnetic structure factor, other metrics for antiferromagnetic and charge-density-wave order, and energetics of the electronic and lattice degrees of freedom as a function of electron-phonon coupling.

The theory contains two dimensionless coupling constants: $\kappa$, the length of the local spin variable, and x=(2g2a2)-1, where g is the electrodynamic coupling and a is the lattice spacing.

The critical point $\kappa$c2 is estimated to lie between 0.6 and 0.8.

abstract = {A set of renormalization group recursion formulas which were proposed by Migdal are rederived, reinterpreted, and critically analyzed. The new derivation shows the connection between these formulas and previous work on renormalization via decimation and block transformations. The new interpretation which arises from these derivations indicates that Midgal's formulas are best understood as referring to systems in which the couplings are anisotropic. A strong indication of the correctness of this reinterpretation comes from the two-dimensional Ising model: The new interpretation gives an exact (!) expression for the critical couplings in this case for all ratios of Jx to Jy. This paper describes the major failings of this approximation which arise from its source as a decimation approximation, in terms of the well-known inadequacy of the fixed points which result from this type of scheme. Some proposals for improvement of the approximation are described. Finally, a new potential-moving scheme is proposed which is used to show that the Migdal approximation is exact when the potentials are strong and ferromagnetic in sign. {\textcopyright} 1976.},

We give both relativistic and nonrelativistic examples of the last case in various dimensions and show that the critical behavior of the mass gap behaves similarly to the correlation length in the finite temperature Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) phase transition in two dimensions, $\xi$∼exp (c/|T-Tc|1/2). We speculate that the chiral phase transition in QCD at large number of fermion flavors belongs to this universality class, and attempt to identify the UV fixed point that annihilates with the Banks-Zaks fixed point at the lower end of the conformal window. {\textcopyright} 2009 The American Physical Society.},

abstract = {Recently, the possibility of quantum simulation of dynamical gauge fields was pointed out by using a system of cold atoms trapped on each link in an optical lattice. However, to implement exact local gauge invariance, fine-tuning the interaction parameters among atoms is necessary. In the present Letter, we study the effect of violation of the U(1) local gauge invariance by relaxing the fine-tuning of the parameters and showing that a wide variety of cold atoms is still a faithful quantum simulator for a U(1) gauge-Higgs model containing a Higgs field sitting on sites. The clarification of the dynamics of this gauge-Higgs model sheds some light upon various unsolved problems, including the inflation process of the early Universe. We study the phase structure of this model by Monte Carlo simulation and also discuss the atomic characteristics of the Higgs phase in each simulator. {\textcopyright} 2013 American Physical Society.},

The local gauge symmetry is realized in an optical superlattice, using heteronuclear boson-fermion spin-changing interactions which preserve the total spin in every local collision. We consider a large number of bosons residing in the coherent state of a Bose-Einstein condensate on each link between the fermion lattice sites, such that the behavior of lattice QED in the continuum limit can be recovered. The discussion about the range of possible experimental parameters builds, in particular, upon experiences with related setups of fermions interacting with coherent samples of bosonic atoms. We determine the atomic system's parameters required for the description of fundamental QED processes, such as Schwinger pair production and string breaking. This is achieved by benchmark calculations of the atomic system and of QED itself using functional integral techniques. Our results demonstrate that the dynamics of one-dimensional QED may be realized with ultracold atoms using state-of-the-art experimental resources. The experimental setup proposed may provide a unique access to longstanding open questions for which classical computational methods are no longer applicable.},

We experimentally studied the emergence of statistical mechanics in a quantum state and observed the fundamental role of quantum entanglement in facilitating this emergence. Microscopy of an evolving quantum system indicates that the full quantum state remains pure, whereas thermalization occurs on a local scale. We directly measured entanglement entropy, which assumes the role of the thermal entropy in thermalization. The entanglement creates local entropy that validates the use of statistical physics for local observables. Our measurements are consistent with the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis.},

Together with the eigenvalues of V, the matrix $\Psi$ which diagonalizes V is obtained as a spin-representation of a known rotation.

For a perturbative series terminated at odd order, the error can only be minimized. It is, however, possible to introduce a mass shift [Formula Presented] in order to obtain the exact result. We discuss weak and strong coupling methods to determine [Formula Presented] and [Formula Presented] The numerical calculations in this article are performed with a simple integral with one variable. We give arguments indicating that the qualitative features observed should extend to quantum mechanics and quantum field theory. We find that optimization at even order is more efficient than optimization at odd order. We compare our methods with the linear [Formula Presented] expansion (LDE) (combined with the principle of minimal sensitivity), which provides an upper envelope for the accuracy curves of various Pad{\'{e}} and Pad{\'{e}}-Borel approximants. Our optimization method performs better than the LDE at strong and intermediate coupling, but not at weak coupling, where it appears less robust and subject to further improvements. We also show that it is possible to fix the arbitrary parameter appearing in the LDE using the strong coupling expansion, in order to get accuracies comparable to ours. {\textcopyright} 2004 The American Physical Society.},

abstract = {The celebrated work of Berezinskii, Koster- litz and Thouless in the 1970s revealed exotic phases of matter governed by topological prop- erties of low-dimensional materials such as thin films of super fluids and superconductors. Key to this phenomenon is the appearance and inter- action of vortices and antivortices in an angular degree of freedom-typified by the classical XY model-due to thermal fluctuations. In the 2D Ising model this angular degree of freedom is ab- sent in the classical case, but with the addition of a transverse field it can emerge from the in- terplay between frustration and quantum fluctuations. Consequently a Kosterlitz-Thouless (KT) phase transition has been predicted in the quan- tum system by theory and simulation. Here we demonstrate a large-scale quantum simulation of this phenomenon in a network of 1,800 in situ pro- grammable superconducting flux qubits arranged in a fully-frustrated square-octagonal lattice. Es- sential to the critical behavior, we observe the emergence of a complex order parameter with continuous rotational symmetry, and the onset of quasi-long-range order as the system approaches a critical temperature. We use a simple but previ- ously undemonstrated approach to statistical esti- mation with an annealing-based quantum proces- sor, performing Monte Carlo sampling in a chain of reverse quantum annealing protocols. Obser- vations are consistent with classical simulations across a range of Hamiltonian parameters. We anticipate that our approach of using a quantum processor as a programmable magnetic lattice will find widespread use in the simulation and devel- opment of exotic materials.},

An important characteristic of these CFTs is the finite part of the entanglement entropy across a circle. The negative of this quantity is equal to the finite part of the free energy of the Euclidean CFT on the three-sphere, and it has been proposed to satisfy the so called F-theorem, which states that it decreases under RG flow and is stationary at RG fixed points. We calculate the three-sphere free energy of non-supersymmetric gauge theory with a large number NF of bosonic and/or fermionic flavors to the first subleading order in 1/NF. We also calculate the exact free energies of the analogous chiral and non-chiral N = 2 supersymmetric theories using localization, and find agreement with the 1/NF expansion. We analyze some RG flows of supersymmetric theories, providing further evidence for the F-theorem. {\textcopyright} SISSA 2012.},

We examine the precise vanishing mechanism of such infrared renormalons, which avoids this (only apparent) contradiction, and operates without need of (Borel) summation contour prescription, usually preventing unambiguous separation of perturbative contributions. As a consequence we stress the direct Borel summability of the (1/N) perturbative expansion of the mass gap.

abstract = {Two topics of lattice gauge theory are reviewed. They include string tension and $\beta$-function calculations by strong coupling Hamiltonian methods for SU(3) gauge fields in 3 + 1 dimensions, and a 1/N-expansion for discrete gauge and spin systems in all dimensions. The SU(3) calculations give solid evidence for the coexistence of quark confinement and asymptotic freedom in the renormalized continuum limit of the lattice theory. The crossover between weak and strong coupling behavior in the theory is seen to be a weak coupling but non-perturbative effect. Quantitative relationships between perturbative and non-perturbative renormalization schemes are obtained for the O(N) nonlinear sigma models in 1 + 1 dimensions as well as the range theory in 3 + 1 dimensions. Analysis of the strong coupling expansion of the $\beta$-function for gauge fields suggests that it has cuts in the complex 1/g2-plane. A toy model of such a cut structure which naturally explains the abruptness of the theory's crossover from weak to strong coupling is presented. The relation of these cuts to other approaches to gauge field dynamics is discussed briefly. The dynamics underlying first order phase transitions in a wide class of lattice gauge theories is exposed by considering a class of models-P(N) gauge theories - which are soluble in the N → ∞ limit and have non-trivial phase diagrams. The first order character of the phase transitions in Potts spin systems for N {\#}62; 4 in 1 + 1 dimensions is explained in simple terms which generalizes to P(N) gauge systems in higher dimensions. The phase diagram of Ising lattice gauge theory coupled to matter fields is obtained in a 1 N expansion. A one-plaquette model (1 time-0 space dimensions) with a first-order phase transitions in the N → ∞ limit is discussed. {\textcopyright} 1980.},

The RHMC algorithm uses rational approximations to fractional powers of the quadratic Dirac operator. Such approximations are only available when positive upper and lower bounds to the operator's spectrum are known. We apply the RHMC algorithm to simulations of 2 theories for which a positive lower spectral bound is unknown: lattice QCD with staggered quarks at finite isospin chemical potential and lattice QCD with massless staggered quarks and chiral 4-fermion interactions ($\chi$QCD). A choice of lower bound is made in each case, and the properties of the RHMC simulations these define are studied. Justification of our choices of lower bounds is made by comparing measurements with those from HMD simulations, and by comparing different choices of lower bounds. {\textcopyright} 2006 The American Physical Society.},

abstract = {We continue our lattice simulations of QCD with 2 flavors of color-sextet quarks as a model for conformal or walking technicolor. A 2-loop perturbative calculation of the $\beta$ function which describes the evolution of this theory's running coupling constant predicts that it has a second zero at a finite coupling. This nontrivial zero would be an infrared stable fixed point, in which case the theory with massless quarks would be a conformal field theory. However, if the interaction between quarks and antiquarks becomes strong enough that a chiral condensate forms before this IR fixed point is reached, the theory is QCD-like with spontaneously broken chiral symmetry and confinement. However, the presence of the nearby IR fixed point means that there is a range of couplings for which the running coupling evolves very slowly, i.e. it "walks." We are simulating the lattice version of this theory with staggered quarks at finite temperature, studying the changes in couplings at the deconfinement and chiral-symmetry restoring transitions as the temporal extent (Nt) of the lattice, measured in lattice units, is increased. Our earlier results on lattices with Nt=4, 6 show both transitions move to weaker couplings as Nt increases consistent with walking behavior. In this paper we extend these calculations to Nt=8. Although both transitions again move to weaker couplings, the change in the coupling at the chiral transition from Nt=6 to Nt=8 is appreciably smaller than that from Nt=4 to Nt=6. This indicates that at Nt=4, 6 we are seeing strong-coupling effects and that we will need results from Nt{\textgreater}8 to determine if the chiral-transition coupling approaches zero as Nt→∞, as needed for the theory to walk. {\textcopyright} 2011 American Physical Society.},

abstract = {QCD with two flavors of massless color-sextet quarks is considered as a model for conformal/walking technicolor. If this theory possesses an infrared fixed point, as indicated by 2-loop perturbation theory, it is a conformal (unparticle) field theory. If, on the other hand, a chiral condensate forms on the weak-coupling side of this would-be fixed point, the theory remains confining. The only difference between such a theory and regular QCD is that there is a range of momentum scales over which the coupling constant runs very slowly (walks). In this first analysis, we simulate the lattice version of QCD with two flavors of staggered quarks at finite temperatures on lattices of temporal extent Nt=4 and 6. The deconfinement and chiral-symmetry restoration couplings give us a measure of the scales associated with confinement and chiral-symmetry breaking. We find that, in contrast to what is seen with fundamental quarks, these transition couplings are very different. $\beta$=6/g2 for each of these transitions increases significantly from Nt=4 and Nt=6 as expected for the finite-temperature transitions of an asymptotically free theory. This suggests a walking rather than a conformal behavior, in contrast to what is observed with Wilson quarks. In contrast to what is found for fundamental quarks, the deconfined phase exhibits states in which the Polyakov loop is oriented in the directions of all three cube roots of unity. At very weak coupling the states with complex Polyakov loops undergo a transition to a state with a real, negative Polyakov loop. {\textcopyright} 2010 The American Physical Society.},

abstract = {This article is an interdisciplinary review of lattice gauge theory and spin systems. It discusses the fundamentals, both physics and formalism, of these related subjects. Spin systems are models of magnetism and phase transitions. Lattice gauge theories are cutoff formulations of gauge theories of strongly interacting particles. Statistical mechanics and field theory are closely related subjects, and the connections between them are developed here by using the transfer matrix. Phase diagrams and critical points of continuous transitions are stressed as the keys to understanding the character and continuum limits of lattice theories. Concepts such as duality, kink condensation, and the existence of a local, relativistic field theory at a critical point of a lattice theory are illustrated in a thorough discussion of the two-dimensional Ising model. Theories with exact local (gauge) symmetries are introduced following Wegner's Ising lattice gauge theory. Its gauge-invariant "loop" correlation function is discussed in detail. Three-dimensional Ising gauge theory is studied thoroughly. The renormalization group of the two dimensional planar model is presented as an illustration of a phase transition driven by the condensation of topological excitations. Parallels are drawn to Abelian lattice gauge theory in four dimensions. Non-Abelian gauge theories are introduced and the possibility of quark confinement is discussed. Asymptotic freedom of O(n) Heisenberg spin systems in two dimensions is verified for n and is explained in simple terms. The direction of present-day research is briefly reviewed. {\textcopyright} 1979 American Physical Society.},

We show how to train a multi-layer generative model that learns to extract meaningful features which resemble those found in the human visual cortex. Using a novel parallelization algorithm to distribute the work among multiple machines connected on a network, we show how training such a model can be done in reasonable time. A second problematic aspect of the tiny images dataset is that there are no reliable class labels which makes it hard to use for object recognition experiments.

abstract = {Motivated by the search for an experimentally realizable high density and strongly interacting one-dimensional quantum liquid, we have performed quantum Monte Carlo simulations of bosonic helium-4 confined inside a nanopore with cylindrical symmetry. By implementing two numerical estimators of superfluidity corresponding to capillary flow and the rotating bucket experiment, we have simultaneously measured the finite size and temperature superfluid response of 4He to the longitudinal and rotational motion of the walls of a nanopore. Within the two-fluid model, the portion of the normal liquid dragged along with the boundaries is dependent on the type of motion, and the resulting anisotropic superfluid density plateaus far below unity at T=0.5K. The origin of the saturation is uncovered by computing the spatial distribution of superfluidity, with only the core of the nanopore exhibiting any evidence of phase coherence. The superfluid core displays a scaling behavior consistent with Luttinger liquid theory, thereby providing an experimental test for the emergence of a one-dimensional quantum liquid. {\textcopyright} 2013 American Physical Society.},

abstract = {In the face of mounting numerical evidence, Metlitski and Grover (arXiv:1112.5166) have given compelling analytical arguments that systems with spontaneous broken continuous symmetry contain a subleading contribution to the entanglement entropy that diverges logarithmically with system size. They predict that the coefficient of this log is a universal quantity that depends on the number of Goldstone modes. In this paper, we confirm the presence of this log term through quantum Monte Carlo calculations of the second R{\'{e}}nyi entropy on the spin-1/2 XY model. Devising an algorithm to facilitate convergence of entropy data at extremely low temperatures, we demonstrate that the single Goldstone mode in the ground state can be identified through the coefficient of the log term. Furthermore, our simulation accuracy allows us to obtain an additional geometric constant additive to the R{\'{e}}nyi entropy, that matches a predicted fully universal form obtained from a free bosonic field theory with no adjustable parameters.},

Starting from the extended Bose-Hubbard model with on-site and nearest-neighbor interactions, we derive the U(1) lattice gauge-Higgs model as a low-energy effective theory. The derived gauge-Higgs model exhibits nontrivial phase transitions between the confinement and Higgs phases, and we discuss the relation with the phase transition in the extended Bose-Hubbard model. Finally, we study the real-time dynamics of an electric flux by the Gross-Pitaevskii equations and the truncated Wigner approximation. The dynamics is governed by a bosonic analog of the Schwinger mechanism - i.e., the shielding of an electric flux by a condensation of Higgs fields, which occurs differently in the Higgs and the confinement phases. These results, together with the obtained phase diagrams, shall guide experimentalists in designing quantum simulations of the gauge-Higgs models by using cold gases.},

abstract = {Preamble: Recent non-perturbative lattice studies beyond the Standard Model (BSM) is the main focus of this review which is based on a plenary talk at Lattice 2013 [1] followed within a short time by a similar review at the KMI symposium. I was delighted to highlight in Nagoya the excellent contributions of the LatKMI collaboration. This group has grown into a major international force in lattice BSM studies soon after the inauguration of KMI. The review is limited to selected topics and does not include new developments of the last tewelve month since the two conferences. The written version of the talks in the two proceedings had to be nearly identical. After its energy upgrade the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) will directly look for new physics including searches for supersymmetry (SUSY) and Beyond the Standard Model (BSM) signals of the composite Higgs mechanism as alternates to the elementary Higgs of the Standard Model. We will demonstrate that non-perturbative simulations of strongly coupled gauge theories (SCGT) have predictive power for experimental searches on the Energy Frontier. Lattice simulations can significantly contribute to our understanding of important BSM paradigms, like SUSY, conformal and near-conformal quantum field theories with implications for the dilaton state, or the alternative composite light scalar as the scalar pseudo-Goldstone boson from global symmetry breaking. Exploratory lattice studies identify tantalizing candidate theories for the composite Higgs mechanism with a light scalar state (Higgs impostor) on the Electroweak scale. The viability of this paradigm requires a composite resonance spectrum in the 2 TeV range, or higher, far separated from the Electroweak scale, and perhaps within the reach of Run 2 of the LHC.},

These theories share important features with (3 + 1)-d QCD, such as asymptotic freedom and $\theta$-vacua. Moreover, their continuum limit can be accessed via the mechanism of dimensional reduction. In our scheme, the CP(N-1) degrees of freedom emerge at low energies from a ladder system of SU(N) quantum spins, where the N spin states are embodied by the nuclear Zeeman states of alkaline-earth atoms, trapped in an optical lattice. Based on Monte Carlo results, we establish that the continuum limit can be demonstrated by an atomic quantum simulation by employing the feature of asymptotic freedom. We discuss a protocol for the adiabatic preparation of the ground state of the system, the real-time evolution of a false $\theta$-vacuum state after a quench, and we propose experiments to unravel the phase diagram at non-zero density.},

In the Haldane insulator, the lowest entanglement level features a characteristic twofold degeneracy. Increasing the ratio between the nearest-neighbor and local Coulomb interaction V/U, the enhancement of the entanglement entropy, the variation of the charge, spin, and neutral gaps, and the dynamical spin and density response signal a quantum phase transition to a charge-ordered state. Below a critical point, which belongs to the universality class of the tricritical Ising model with central charge 7/10, the model is critical with c=1/2 along the transition line.

Predictions are given for the scaling behavior, angular dependence, helicity structure, and normalization of elastic and inelastic form factors and large-angle exclusive scattering amplitudes for hadrons and photons. We prove that these reactions are dominated by quark and gluon subprocesses at short distances, and thus that the dimensional-counting rules for the power-law falloff of these amplitudes with momentum transfer are rigorous predictions of QCD, modulo calculable logarithmic corrections from the behavior of the hadronic wave functions at short distances. These anomalous-dimension corrections are determined by evolution equations for process-independent meson and baryon "distribution amplitudes" (xi,Q) which control the valence-quark distributions in high-momentum-transfer exclusive reactions. The analysis can be carried out systematically in powers of +s(Q2), the QCD running coupling constant. Although the calculations are most conveniently carried out using light-cone perturbation theory and the light-cone gauge, we also present a gauge-independent analysis and relate the distribution amplitude to a gauge-invariant Bethe-Salpeter amplitude. {\textcopyright} 1980 The American Physical Society.},

abstract = {In this paper we show that the apparent failure of QCD lattice perturbation theory to account for Monte Carlo measurements of perturbative quantities results from choosing the bare lattice coupling constant as the expansion parameter. Using instead "renormalized" coupling constants defined in terms of physical quantities, such as the heavy-quark potential, greatly enhances the predictive power of lattice perturbation theory. The quality of these predictions is further enhanced by a method for automatically determining the coupling-constant scale most appropriate to a particular quantity. We present a mean-field analysis that explains the large renormalizations relating lattice quantities, such as the coupling constant, to their continuum analogues. This suggests a new prescription for designing lattice operators that are more continuumlike than conventional operators. Finally, we provide evidence that the scaling of physical quantities can be asymptotic or perturbative already at (quenched) 's as low as 5.7, provided the evolution from scale to scale is analyzed using renormalized perturbation theory. This result indicates that reliable simulations of QCD are possible at these same low 's. {\textcopyright} 1993 The American Physical Society.},

These new phases of matter have the unusual property that their collective excitations are gauge bosons and fermions. In some cases, the collective excitations can behave just like the photons, electrons, gluons, and quarks in our vacuum. This suggests that photons, electrons, and other elementary particles may have a unified origin-string-net condensation in our vacuum.

abstract = {We consider Wilson's SU(N) lattice gauge theory (without fermions) at negative values of $\beta$ = 2N/g2 and for N = 2 or 3. We show that in the limit $\beta$ → -∞, the path integral is dominated by configurations where links variables are set to a nontrivial element of the center on selected nonintersecting lines. For N = 2, these configurations can be characterized by a unique gauge invariant set of variables, while for N = 3 a multiplicity growing with the volume as the number of configurations of an Ising model is observed. In general, there is a discontinuity in the average plaquette when g2 changes its sign which prevents us from having a convergent series in g2 for this quantity. For N = 2, a change of variables relates the gauge invariant observables at positive and negative values of $\beta$. For N = 3, we derive an identity relating the observables at $\beta$ with those at $\beta$ rotated by ±2$\pi$/3 in the complex plane and show numerical evidence for a Ising like first order phase transition near $\beta$ = -22. We discuss the possibility of having lines of first order phase transitions ending at a second order phase transition in an extended bare parameter space. {\textcopyright} 2005 The American Physical Society.},

abstract = {We discuss the weak coupling expansion of a one-plaquette SU(2) lattice gauge theory. We show that the conventional perturbative series for the partition function has a zero radius of convergence and is asymptotic. The average plaquette is discontinuous at g 2 = 0. However, the fact that SU(2) is compact provides a perturbative sum that converges toward the correct answer for positive g 2. This alternate method amounts to introducing a specific coupling-dependent field cut, that turns the coefficients into g-dependent quantities. Generalizing to an arbitrary field cut, we obtain a regular power series with a finite radius of convergence. At any order in the modified perturbative procedure, and for a given coupling, it is possible to find at least one (and sometimes two) values of the field cut that provide the exact answer. This optimal field cut can be determined approximately using the strong coupling expansion. This allows us to interpolate accurately between the weak and strong coupling regions. We discuss the extension of the method to lattice gauge theory on a D-dimensional cubic lattice. {\textcopyright} 2005 The American Physical Society.},

For the two lowest orders in $\lambda$, the approximate formulae obtained in the large field cutoff limit extend unexpectedly far in the low field cutoff region and there is a significant overlap with the small field cutoff approximation.

For quenched QCD, the sensitivity of the average plaquette to a removal of large field configurations has a narrow peak near $\beta$ = 5.6.

We report results of numerical calculations. The peak in the third derivative of the free energy present on 44 lattices disappears if the size of the lattice is increased isotropically up to a 104 lattice. On the other hand, on 4×L3 lattices, it persists when L increases. The location of the peak coincides with the onset of a non-zero average for the Polyakov loop and seems related to the finite temperature transition.

Using a series for the average plaquette up to order 10 in the weak coupling parameter $\beta$-1, we show that the analysis of the extrapolated ratio and the extrapolated slope suggests the possibility of a nonanalytical power behavior of the form (1/$\beta$-1/5.7(1))1.0(1), in agreement with another analysis based on the same assumption. This would imply that the third derivative of the free energy density diverges near $\beta$=5.7. We show that the peak in the third derivative of the free energy present on 44 lattices disappears if the size of the lattice is increased isotropically up to a 104 lattice. On the other hand, on 4×L3 lattices, a jump in the third derivative persists when L increases, and follows closely the known values of $\beta$c for the first order finite temperature transition. We show that the apparent contradiction at zero temperature can be resolved by moving the singularity in the complex 1/$\beta$ plane. If the imaginary part of the location of the singularity $\Gamma$ is within the range 0.001{\textless}$\Gamma${\textless}0.01, it is possible to limit the second derivative of P within an acceptable range without affecting drastically the behavior of the perturbative coefficients.

The model performs hierarchical change-of-variables transformations from the physical space to a latent space with reduced mutual information. Conversely, the neural network directly maps independent Gaussian noises to physical configurations following the inverse RG flow. The model has an exact and tractable likelihood, which allows unbiased training and direct access to the renormalized energy function of the latent variables. To train the model, we employ probability density distillation for the bare energy function of the physical problem, in which the training loss provides a variational upper bound of the physical free energy. We demonstrate practical usage of the approach by identifying mutually independent collective variables of the Ising model and performing accelerated hybrid Monte Carlo sampling in the latent space. Lastly, we comment on the connection of the present approach to the wavelet formulation of RG and the modern pursuit of information preserving RG.},

abstract = {Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods sample from unnormalized probability distributions and offer guarantees of exact sampling. However, in the continuous case, unfavorable geometry of the target distribution can greatly limit the efficiency of MCMC methods. Augmenting samplers with neural networks can potentially improve their efficiency. Previous neural network-based samplers were trained with objectives that either did not explicitly encourage exploration, or contained a term that encouraged exploration but only for well structured distributions. Here we propose to maximize proposal entropy for adapting the proposal to distributions of any shape. To optimize proposal entropy directly, we devised a neural network MCMC sampler that has a flexible and tractable proposal distribution. Specifically, our network architecture utilizes the gradient of the target distribution for generating proposals. Our model achieved significantly higher efficiency than previous neural network MCMC techniques in a variety of sampling tasks, sometimes by more than an order magnitude. Further, the sampler was demonstrated through the training of a convergent energy-based model of natural images. The adaptive sampler achieved unbiased sampling with significantly higher proposal entropy than a Langevin dynamics sample. The trained sampler also achieved better sample quality.},

abstract = {Several functional renormalisation group (RG) equations including Polchinski flows and Exact RG flows are compared from a conceptual point of view and in given truncations. Similarities and differences are highlighted with special emphasis on stability properties. The main observations are worked out at the example of O(N) symmetric scalar field theories where the flows, universal critical exponents and scaling potentials are compared within a derivative expansion. To leading order, it is established that Polchinski flows and ERG flows - despite their inequivalent derivative expansions - have identical universal content, if the ERG flow is amended by an adequate optimisation. The results are also evaluated in the light of stability and minimum sensitivity considerations. Extensions to higher order and further implications are emphasized. {\textcopyright} SISSA 2005.},

abstract = {Within the exact renormalisation group, the scaling solutions for O(N) symmetric scalar field theories are studied to leading order in the derivative expansion. The Gaussian fixed point is examined for d {\textgreater} 2 dimensions and arbitrary infrared regularisation. The Wilson-Fisher fixed point in d = 3 is studied using an optimised flow. We compute critical exponents and subleading corrections-to-scaling to high accuracy from the eigenvalues of the stability matrix at criticality for all N. We establish that the optimisation is responsible for the rapid convergence of the flow and polynomial truncations thereof. The scheme dependence of the leading critical exponent is analysed. For all N ≥ 0, it is found that the leading exponent is bounded. The upper boundary is achieved for a Callan-Symanzik flow and corresponds, for all N, to the large-N limit. The lower boundary is achieved by the optimised flow and is closest to the physical value. We show the reliability of polynomial approximations, even to low orders, if they are accompanied by an appropriate choice for the regulator. Possible applications to other theories are outlined. {\textcopyright} 2002 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.},

abstract = {A simple criterion to optimise coarse-grainings for exact renormalisation group equations is given. It is aimed at improving the convergence of approximate solutions of flow equations. The optimisation criterion is generic, as it refers only to the coarse-grained propagator at vanishing field. In physical terms, it is understood as an optimisation condition for amplitude expansions. Alternatively, it can be interpreted as the requirement to move poles of threshold functions away from the physical region. The link to expansions in field amplitudes is discussed as well. Optimal parameters are given explicitly for a variety of different coarse-grainings. As a by-product it is found that the sharp cut-off regulator does not belong to the class of such optimal coarse-grainings, which explains the poor convergence of amplitude expansions based on it.

This opens the possibility of letting nature take care of sign problems and real time evolution in carefully prepared situations. Up to now, experimentalists have succeeded to implement several types of Hubbard models considered by condensed matter theorists. In this proceeding, we discuss the possibility of extending this effort to lattice gauge theory. We report recent efforts to establish the strong coupling equivalence between the Fermi Hubbard model and SU(2) pure gauge theory in 2+1 dimensions by standard determinantal methods developed by Robert Sugar and collaborators.

abstract = {We point out that the flavor problem in theories with dynamical electroweak symmetry breaking can be effectively decoupled if the physics above the TeV scale is strongly conformal, and the electroweak order parameter has a scaling dimension d = 1+$\epsilon$ with $\epsilon$ ≃ 1/few. There are many restrictions on small values of $\epsilon$: for $\epsilon$ ≪ 1, electroweak symmetry breaking requires a fine-tuning similar to that of the standard model; large-N conformal field theories (including those obtained from the AdS/CFT correspondence) require fine-tuning for d {\textless} 2; 'walking technicolor' theories cannot have d {\textless} 2, according to gap equation analyses. However, strong small-N conformal field theories with $\epsilon$ ≃ 1/few avoid all these constraints, and can give rise to natural dynamical electroweak symmetry breaking with a top quark flavor scale of order 101/$\epsilon$TeV, large enough to decouple flavor. Small-N theories also have an acceptably small Peskin-Takeuchi S parameter. This class of theories provides a new direction for dynamical electroweak symmetry breaking without problems from flavor or electroweak precision tests. A possible signal for these theories is a prominent scalar resonance below the TeV scale with couplings similar to a heavy standard model Higgs. {\textcopyright} SISSA 2006.},

abstract = {The basic concepts and formulation of the renormalization group are explained beginning at an elementary level. Discussion is in the framework of classical statistical mechanics with emphasis on applications to the theory of critical phenomena. The details are worked out in the large n limit for 2 {\textless} d {\textless} 4, where n is the number of components of the fluctuating field of interest and d is the dimension of the thermodynamical system. In the large n limit, the infinite sum of "tree graphs" offers an exact and analytically tractable description of the renormalization group. It illustrates many concepts including the fixed point, the critical surface in the space of coupling parameters, and critical exponents. Most important, it illustrates the origin and the limitation of the scaling hypothesis. The critical behavior of various correlation functions and the free energy is examined. Attention is paid to terms often ignored in qualitative scaling arguments. We have attempted to make this paper self-contained and of pedagogical value to a wide audience.

abstract = {Gauge theories are fundamental to our understanding of interactions between the elementary constituents of matter as mediated by gauge bosons. However, computing the real-time dynamics in gauge theories is a notorious challenge for classical computational methods. This has recently stimulated theoretical effort, using Feynman's idea of a quantum simulator, to devise schemes for simulating such theories on engineered quantum-mechanical devices, with the difficulty that gauge invariance and the associated local conservation laws (Gauss laws) need to be implemented. Here we report the experimental demonstration of a digital quantum simulation of a lattice gauge theory, by realizing (1 + 1)-dimensional quantum electrodynamics (the Schwinger model) on a few-qubit trapped-ion quantum computer. We are interested in the real-time evolution of the Schwinger mechanism, describing the instability of the bare vacuum due to quantum fluctuations, which manifests itself in the spontaneous creation of electron-positron pairs. To make efficient use of our quantum resources, we map the original problem to a spin model by eliminating the gauge fields in favour of exotic long-range interactions, which can be directly and efficiently implemented on an ion trap architecture. We explore the Schwinger mechanism of particle-antiparticle generation by monitoring the mass production and the vacuum persistence amplitude. Moreover, we track the real-time evolution of entanglement in the system, which illustrates how particle creation and entanglement generation are directly related. Our work represents a first step towards quantum simulation of high-energy theories using atomic physics experiments - the long-term intention is to extend this approach to real-time quantum simulations of non-Abelian lattice gauge theories.},

We identify the dominant terms that need to be retained in realistic experimental conditions, up to nearest-neighbor interactions and nearest-neighbor hoppings conditioned by the on-site occupation numbers. In the mean field approximation, we determine the free energy of the system and study the phase diagram both at zero and at finite temperature. At variance with the standard on site Bose Hubbard model, the zero-temperature phase diagram of the EBH model possesses a dual structure in the Mott insulating regime. Namely, for specific ranges of the lattice parameters, a density wave phase characterizes the system at integer fillings, with domains of alternating mean occupation numbers that are the atomic counterparts of the domains of staggered magnetizations in an antiferromagnetic phase. We show as well that in the EBH model, a zero-temperature quantum phase transition to pair superfluidity is, in principle, possible, but completely suppressed at the lowest order in the lattice attenuation factor. Finally, we determine the possible occurrence of the different phases as a function of the experimentally controllable lattice parameters. {\textcopyright} 2006 The American Physical Society.},

We apply this method to the scalar {\$}\backslashvarphi{\^{}}4{\$} lattice field theory in the weak-coupling regime and, in doing so, greatly increase the system sizes explored to date with this self-learning technique. Our approach does not rely on a pre-existing training set of samples, as the agent systematically improves its performance by bootstrapping samples collected by the model itself. We evaluate the performance of the trained model by examining its mixing time and study the ergodicity of generated samples. When compared to methods such as Hamiltonian Monte Carlo, this approach provides unique advantages such as the speed of inference and a compressed representation of Monte Carlo proposals for potential use in downstream tasks.},

abstract = {Machine Learning (ML) is one of the most exciting and dynamic areas of modern research and application. The purpose of this review is to provide an introduction to the core concepts and tools of machine learning in a manner easily understood and intuitive to physicists. The review begins by covering fundamental concepts in ML and modern statistics such as the bias–variance tradeoff, overfitting, regularization, generalization, and gradient descent before moving on to more advanced topics in both supervised and unsupervised learning. Topics covered in the review include ensemble models, deep learning and neural networks, clustering and data visualization, energy-based models (including MaxEnt models and Restricted Boltzmann Machines), and variational methods. Throughout, we emphasize the many natural connections between ML and statistical physics. A notable aspect of the review is the use of Python Jupyter notebooks to introduce modern ML/statistical packages to readers using physics-inspired datasets (the Ising Model and Monte-Carlo simulations of supersymmetric decays of proton–proton collisions). We conclude with an extended outlook discussing possible uses of machine learning for furthering our understanding of the physical world as well as open problems in ML where physicists may be able to contribute.},

abstract = {Deep learning is a broad set of techniques that uses multiple layers of representation to automatically learn relevant features directly from structured data. Recently, such techniques have yielded record-breaking results on a diverse set of difficult machine learning tasks in computer vision, speech recognition, and natural language processing. Despite the enormous success of deep learning, relatively little is understood theoretically about why these techniques are so successful at feature learning and compression. Here, we show that deep learning is intimately related to one of the most important and successful techniques in theoretical physics, the renormalization group (RG). RG is an iterative coarse-graining scheme that allows for the extraction of relevant features (i.e. operators) as a physical system is examined at different length scales. We construct an exact mapping from the variational renormalization group, first introduced by Kadanoff, and deep learning architectures based on Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs). We illustrate these ideas using the nearest-neighbor Ising Model in one and two-dimensions. Our results suggests that deep learning algorithms may be employing a generalized RG-like scheme to learn relevant features from data.},

For extended regions of parameter space, calculable for each model, duality resolves the sign problem for both analytic methods and computer simulations. Explicit duality relations are given for models for spin and gauge models based on Z(N) and U(1) symmetry groups. The dual forms are generalizations of the Z(N) chiral clock model and the lattice Frenkel-Kontorova model, respectively. From these equivalences, rich sets of spatially-modulated phases are found in the strong-coupling region of the original models.},

The coefficient of this "area law" is nonuniversal. However, in the neighborhood of a quantum critical point S is believed to possess subleading universal corrections. In the present work, we study the entanglement entropy in the quantum O (N) model in 1{\textless}d{\textless}3. We use an expansion in =3-d to evaluate (i) the universal geometric correction to S for an infinite cylinder divided along a circular boundary; (ii) the universal correction to S due to a finite correlation length. Both corrections are different at the Wilson-Fisher and Gaussian fixed points, and the →0 limit of the Wilson-Fisher fixed point is distinct from the Gaussian fixed point. In addition, we compute the correlation length correction to the Renyi entropy Sn = 1 1-n logtr $\rho$An in and large- N expansions. For N→, this correction generally scales as N2 rather than the naively expected N. Moreover, the Renyi entropy has a phase transition as a function of n for d close to 3. {\textcopyright} 2009 The American Physical Society.},

abstract = {We describe a method to express the susceptibility and higher derivatives of the free energy in terms of the scaling variables (Wegner's nonlinear scaling fields) associated with the high-temperature (HT) fixed point of the Dyson hierarchical model in arbitrary dimensions. We give a closed form solution of the linearized problem. We check that up to order 7 in the HT expansion, all the poles (“small denominators”) that would naively appear in some positive dimension are canceled by zeros (“small numerators”). The requirement of continuity in the dimension can be used to lift ambiguities which appear in calculations at fixed dimension. We show that the existence of a HT phase in the infinite volume limit for a continuous set of values of the dimension, requires that this mechanism works to all orders. On the other hand, most poles at negative values of the dimensional parameter [where the free energy density is not well-defined, but renormalization group (RG) flows can be studied] persist and reflect the fact that for special negative values of the dimension, finite-size corrections become leading terms. We show that the inverse problem is also free of small denominator problems and that the initial values of the scaling variables can be expressed in terms of the infinite volume limit of the susceptibility and higher derivatives of the free energy.

abstract = {For lattice models with compact field integration (nonlinear sigma models over compact manifolds and gauge theories with compact groups) and satisfying some discrete symmetry, the change of sign of the bare coupling g02 at zero results in a mere discontinuity in the average energy rather than the catastrophic instability occurring in theories with integration over arbitrarily large fields. This indicates that the large order of perturbative series and the nonperturbative contributions should have unexpected features. Using the large-N limit of two-dimensional nonlinear O(N) sigma model, we discuss the complex singularities of the average energy for complex 't Hooft coupling $\lambda$t=g02N. A striking difference with the usual situation is the absence of the cut along the negative real axis. We show that the zeros of the partition function can only be inside a clover shape region of the complex $\lambda$t plane. We calculate the density of states and use the result to verify numerically the statement about the zeros. We propose dispersive representations of the derivatives of the average energy for an approximate expression of the discontinuity. The discontinuity is purely nonperturbative and contributions at small negative coupling in one dispersive representation are essential to guarantee that the derivatives become exponentially small when $\lambda$t→0+. We discuss the implications for gauge theories. {\textcopyright} 2009 The American Physical Society.},

For lattice QCD in the quenched approximation, the perturbative series for the average plaquette is dominated at low order by a singularity in the complex coupling plane and the asymptotic behavior can only be reached by using extrapolations of the existing series. We discuss two extrapolations that provide a consistent description of the series up to order 20-25.

abstract = {We review recent results concerning the renormalization group (RG) transformation of Dyson's hierarchical model (HM). This model can be seen as an approximation of a scalar field theory on a lattice. We introduce the HM and show that its large group of symmetry simplifies drastically the blockspinning procedure. Several equivalent forms of the recursion formula are presented with unified notations. Rigourous and numerical results concerning the recursion formula are summarized. It is pointed out that the recursion formula of the HM is inequivalent to both Wilson's approximate recursion formula and Polchinski's equation in the local potential approximation (despite the very small difference with the exponents of the latter). We draw a comparison between the RG of the HM and functional RG equations in the local potential approximation. The construction of the linear and nonlinear scaling variables is discussed in an operational way. We describe the calculation of non-universal critical amplitudes in terms of the scaling variables of two fixed points. This question appears as a problem of interpolation between these fixed points. Universal amplitude ratios are calculated. We discuss the large-N limit and the complex singularities of the critical potential calculable in this limit. The interpolation between the HM and more conventional lattice models is presented as a symmetry breaking problem. We briefly introduce models with an approximate supersymmetry. One important goal of this review is to present a configuration space counterpart, suitable for lattice formulations, of functional RG equations formulated in momentum space (often called exact RG equations and abbreviated ERGE). {\textcopyright} 2007 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

This estimation requires convergent expansions in overlapping domains. If, in addition, the initial values of the scaling fields associated with the unstable fixed point can be calculated from the temperature and the parameters appearing in the microscopic Hamiltonian, one can estimate the critical amplitudes. This strategy has been developed using Dyson's hierarchical model where all the steps can be approximately implemented with good accuracy.

abstract = {We point out that ignoring nonlinear effects in finite size scaling may lead to errors in estimates of the critical temperature and Binder cumulants. We show that the order of magnitude of these effects can be estimated from data at relatively small volume. Using this estimate, we propose to use linear fits in increasingly small temperature regions as the volume is increased (rather than using a fixed temperature interval). The choice of the exact coefficient of proportionality can be optimized and reveals interesting crossing patterns among estimates. We show that the new procedure works very well for Dyson's hierarchical model. We discuss applications of the method for 3 dimensional spin models and finite temperature lattice gauge theories and comment on the nonlinear effects for existing calculations.},

When they pinch the real axis, finite size scaling allows one to distinguish between first and second order transition and to estimate exponents. On the other hand, a gap signals confinement and themethod can be used to explore the boundary of the conformal window. We present recent numerical results for 2D O(N) sigma models, 4D U(1) and SU(2) pure gauge and SU(3) gauge theory with Nf = 4 and 12 flavors. We discuss attempts to understand some of these results using analytical methods. We discuss the 2-lattice matching and qualitative aspects of the renormalization group (RG) flows in the Migdal-Kadanoff approximation, in particular how RG flows starting at large $\beta$seem to move around regions where bulk transitions occur. We consider the effects of the boundary conditions on the nonperturbative part of the average energy and on the Fisher zeros for the 1D O(2) model.},

abstract = {We show that the Tensor Renormalization Group (TRG) method can be applied to O(N) spin models, principal chiral models and pure gauge theories (Z2, U(1) and SU(2)) on (hyper) cubic lattices. We explain that contrarily to some common belief, it is very difficult to write compact formulas expressing the blockspinning of lattice models. We show that in contrast to other approaches, the TRG formulation allows us to write exact blocking formulas with numerically controllable truncations. The basic reason is that the TRG blocking separates neatly the degrees of freedom inside the block and which are integrated over, from those kept to communicate with the neighboring blocks. We argue that the TRG is a method that can handle large volumes, which is crucial to approach quasi-conformal systems. The method can also get rid of some sign problems. We discuss recent results regarding the critical properties of the 2D O(2) nonlinear sigma model with complex b and chemical potential. As some of these results appeared in a recently published paper (PRD 88, 056005) and two recent preprints (arXiv:1309.4963 and arXiv:1309.6623), these proceedings rather emphasize the conceptual aspects of our ongoing effort.},

abstract = {The idea of blocking in configuration space has played an important role in the development of the RG ideas. However, despite being half a century old and having had a huge intellectual impact, generic numerical methods to perform blocking for lattice models have progressed more slowly than sampling methods. Blocking may be essential to deal with near conformal situations. Typically, blocking methods have smaller statistical errors but larger systematic errors than sampling methods. This situation is evolving with recent developments based on the Tensor RG (TRG) method. We report recent results for spin and gauge lattice models obtained with this new method regarding searches for fixed points, calculations of critical exponents and resolutions of sign problems. An interesting model for comparison is the 2-dimensional O(2) model with a chemical potential which has a sign problem with conventional Monte Carlo but allows sampling with the worm algorithm and blocking with various TRG formulations. We compare the efficiency and accuracy of these two methods.},

An emergent contact coupling flows to a fixed point or develops a limit cycle depending on the discriminant of its quadratic beta function. We analyze the fixed points in both conformal and nonconformal phases and perform a natural extension of the renormalization group analysis to complex values of the contact coupling. Physical interpretation and motivation for this extension is the presence of an inelastic scattering channel in two-body collisions. We present a geometric description of the complex generalization by considering renormalization group flows on the Riemann sphere.

The approximation is seen to be a good one, both qualitatively and quantitatively. We then consider the further approximation of truncating the lagrangian to polynomial in the field dependence. Concentrating on the non-perturbative three dimensional Wilson fixed point, we show that the sequence of truncations n = 2,3,..., obtained by expanding about the field $\phi${\{}symbol{\}} = 0 and discarding all powers $\phi${\{}symbol{\}}2n+2 and higher, yields solutions that at first converge to the answer obtained without truncation, but then cease to further converge beyond a certain point.

abstract = {We show that non-perturbative fixed points of the exact renormalization group, their perturbations and corresponding massive field theories can all be determined directly in the continuum - without using bare actions or any tuning procedure. As an example, we estimate the universal couplings of the non-perturbative three-dimensional one-component massive scalar field theory in the Ising model universality class, by using a derivative expansion (and no other approximation). These are compared to the recent results from other methods. At order derivative-squared approximation, the four-point coupling at zero momentum is better determined by other methods, but factoring this out appropriately, all our other results are in very close agreement with the most powerful of these methods. In addition we provide for the first time, estimates of the n-point couplings at zero momentum, with n = 12, 14, and the order momentum-squared parts with n = 2,..., 10. {\textcopyright} 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.},

Here we point out that this is a consequence of an exact map between the two equations, which is nothing other than the exact reduction of the functional map that exists between the two exact renormalization groups. We note also that the optimised cutoff does not allow a derivative expansion beyond second order. {\textcopyright} SISSA 2005.},

Reinterpretations in terms of I.R. cutoff Green's functions are given. A promising nonperturbative approximation scheme is derived by carefully taking the sharp cutoff limit and expanding in “irrelevancy” of operators. We illustrate with two simple models of four-dimensional $\lambda$$\phi$ 4 theory: the cactus approximation, and a model incorporating the first irrelevant correction to the renormalized coupling.

@article{moshe03,
abstract = {We review the solutions of O(N) and U(N) quantum field theories in the large N limit and as 1/N expansions, in the case of vector representations. Since invariant composite fields have small fluctuations for large N, the method relies on constructing effective field theories for composite fields after integration over the original degrees of freedom. We first solve a general scalar U($\phi$2) field theory for N large and discuss various non-perturbative physical issues such as critical behaviour. We show how large N results can also be obtained from variational calculations. We illustrate these ideas by showing that the large N expansion allows to relate the ($\phi$2)2 theory and the non-linear $\sigma$-model, models which are renormalizable in different dimensions. Similarly, a relation between CP(N-1) and abelian Higgs models is exhibited. Large N techniques also allow solving self-interacting fermion models. A relation between the Gross-Neveu, a theory with a four-fermi self-interaction, and a Yukawa-type theory renormalizable in four dimensions then follows. We discuss dissipative dynamics, which is relevant to the approach to equilibrium, and which in some formulation exhibits quantum mechanics supersymmetry. This also serves as an introduction to the study of the 3D supersymmetric quantum field theory. Large N methods are useful in problems that involve a crossover between different dimensions. We thus briefly discuss finite size effects, finite temperature scalar and supersymmetric field theories. We also use large N methods to investigate the weakly interacting Bose gas. The solution of the general scalar U($\phi$2) field theory is then applied to other issues like tricritical behaviour and double scaling limit. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {We minimize the one-loop effective potential for SU(N) gauge theories including fermions with finite mass in the fundamental (F), adjoint (Adj), symmetric (S), and antisymmetric (AS) representations. We calculate the phase diagram on S 1 × ℝ 3 as a function of the length of the compact dimension, $\beta$, and the fermion mass, m, for various N and N f. We consider the effect of periodic boundary conditions [PBC(+)] on fermions as well as antiperiodic boundary conditions [ABC(-)]. With standard ABC(-) on fermions only the deconfined phase is found at one-loop for all representations considered. However, the use of PBC(+) produces a rich phase structure. These phases are distinguished by the eigenvalues of the Polyakov loop P. In the case of fundamental representation fermions [QCD(F,+)], a phase in which ReTr P is minimized (and negative) is favoured for all values of m$\beta$. For N odd charge conjugation (C) symmetry is spontaneously broken in this phase due to O(1/N) effects. Minimization of the effective potential for QCD(AS/S,+) results in a phase where |ImTr P| is maximized, resulting in C-breaking for all N and all values of m$\beta$, however, the partition function is the same up to O(1/N) corrections as when ABC are applied. Therefore, regarding orientifold planar equivalence, we argue that in the one-loop approximation C-breaking in QCD(AS/S,+) resulting from the application of PBC on fermions does not invalidate the large N equivalence with QCD(Adj,-). Similarly, with respect to orbifold planar equivalence, breaking of Z 2 interchange symmetry resulting from application of PBC to bifundamental (BF) representation fermions does not invalidate equivalence with QCD(Adj,-) in the one-loop perturbative limit because the partition functions of QCD(BF,-) and QCD(BF,+) are the same. Of particular interest as well is the case of adjoint fermions where for 1{\$}"N f {\textgreater} 1 Majorana flavour confinement is obtained for sufficiently small m\beta, and deconfinement for sufficiently large m\beta. For N 3 these two phases are separated by one or more additional phases, some of which can be characterized as partially-confining phases. {\textcopyright} SISSA 2009.},

abstract = {The dramatic growth in practical applications for machine learning over the last ten years has been accompanied by many important developments in the underlying algorithms and techniques. For example, Bayesian methods have grown from a specialist niche to become mainstream, while graphical models have emerged as a general framework for describing and applying probabilistic techniques. The practical applicability of Bayesian methods has been greatly enhanced by the development of a range of approximate inference algorithms such as variational Bayes and expectation propagation, while new models based on kernels have had a significant impact on both algorithms and applications. This completely new textbook reflects these recent developments while providing a comprehensive introduction to the fields of pattern recognition and machine learning. It is aimed at advanced undergraduates or first-year PhD students, as well as researchers and practitioners. No previous knowledge of pattern recognition or machine learning concepts is assumed. Familiarity with multivariate calculus and basic linear algebra is required, and some experience in the use of probabilities would be helpful though not essential as the book includes a self-contained introduction to basic probability theory. The book is suitable for courses on machine learning, statistics, computer science, signal processing, computer vision, data mining, and bioinformatics. Extensive support is provided for course instructors, including more than 400 exercises, graded according to difficulty. Example solutions for a subset of the exercises are available from the book web site, while solutions for the remainder can be obtained by instructors from the publisher. The book is supported by a great deal of additional material, and the reader is encouraged to visit the book web site for the latest information. Christopher M. Bishop is Deputy Director of Microsoft Research Cambridge, and holds a Chair in Computer Science at the University of Edinburgh. He is a Fellow of Darwin College Cambridge, a Fellow of the Royal Academy of Engineering, and a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh.

abstract = {Simulated annealing - moving from a tractable distribution to a distribution of interest via a sequence of intermediate distributions - has traditionally been used as an inexact method of handling isolated modes in Markov chain samplers. Here, it is shown how one can use the Markov chain transitions for such an annealing sequence to define an importance sampler. The Markov chain aspect allows this method to perform acceptably even for high-dimensional problems, where finding good importance sampling distributions would otherwise be very difficult, while the use of importance weights ensures that the estimates found converge to the correct values as the number of annealing runs increases. This annealed importance sampling procedure resembles the second half of the previously-studied tempered transitions, and can be seen as a generalization of a recently-proposed variant of sequential importance sampling. It is also related to thermodynamic integration methods for estimating ratios of normalizing constants. Annealed importance sampling is most attractive when isolated modes are present, or when estimates of normalizing constants are required, but it may also be more generally useful, since its independent sampling allows one to bypass some of the problems of assessing convergence and autocorrelation in Markov chain samplers.},

Recently, the framework (Involutive MCMC) was proposed describing a large body of MCMC algorithms via two components: a stochastic acceptance test and an involutive deterministic function. This paper demonstrates that this framework is a special case of a larger family of algorithms operating on orbits of continuous deterministic bijections. We describe this family by deriving a novel MCMC kernel, which we call orbital MCMC (oMCMC). We provide a theoretical analysis and illustrate its utility using simple examples.},

The field has developed a broad spectrum of algorithms, varying in the way they are motivated, the way they are applied and how efficiently they sample. Despite all the differences, many of them share the same core principle, which we unify as the Involutive MCMC (iMCMC) framework. Building upon this, we describe a wide range of MCMC algorithms in terms of iMCMC, and formulate a number of “tricks” which one can use as design principles for developing new MCMC algorithms. Thus, iMCMC provides a unified view of many known MCMC algorithms, which facilitates the derivation of powerful extensions. We demonstrate the latter with two examples where we transform known reversible MCMC algorithms into more efficient irreversible ones.},

abstract = {In dealing with critical phenomena of complex systems that simulate realistic materials, the full structure of the renormalization group is often unnecessarily cumbersome. For approximate calculations and for systems with special properties, specialized generators are simpler to apply. We derive several such exact and approximate differential generators and solve a number of interesting practical problems to illustrate this approach: (i) We derive a new approximate differential generator based on the Wilson incomplete-integration generator. Using this generator we calculate for an n-component spin system the eigenvalues (critical-point exponents) associated with a critical point of arbitrary order O and "propagator exponent" $\sigma${\`{I}} to first order in the expansion parameter $\epsilon$O($\sigma${\`{I}})=d+O($\sigma${\`{I}}-d) ; this extends previous work for $\sigma${\`{I}}=2, O arbitrary; $\sigma${\`{I}}≤2, O=2 (long-rang forces); and $\sigma${\`{I}}=4, O=2 (the "Lifshitz point"). Our results agree with those obtainable using an approximate generator based on the Wegner-Houghton equation. The cases $\sigma${\`{I}}=2L (L a positive integer ‰¥2) describe the onset of helical ordering for which | k→|∼(-p)$\beta$k, where $\beta$k=12(L-1)+o($\epsilon$O2(2L)) and p parametrizes the hypersurface of critical points. For p{\textgreater}0, the ordered phase is uniform; for p{\textless}0 there is spiral order. The point p=0, at which such nonuniform ordering commences, we term a generalized Lifshitz point of Lifschitz character L. (ii) We consider the full Wilson and Wegner-Houghton generators in the paired spin-momenta limit and the n→̂{\v{z}} limit for even-order critical points. These limiting generators are identical for both full generators. This demonstrates that at least in these cases the Wilson and Wegner-Houghton generators agree exactly, without recourse to perturbation theory. These simple exact generators should provide "anchors" for calculations of exponents for higher-order critical points. (iii) We derive approximate generators which are suitable for compressible magnetic systems and more general systems with constraints for which the spin momenta are grouped in any arbitrary manner. We apply this to the case of a simple compressible magnet model and obtain the exact renormalization-group trajectories to order $\epsilon$ with $\epsilon$‰$\epsilon$2(2) =4-d. {\textcopyright} 1976 The American Physical Society.},

We use finite truncations of the Fourier transform of the recursion formula for Dyson's hierarchical model in the symmetric phase to perform high-precision calculations of the unsubtracted Green's functions at zero momentum in dimension 3, 4, and 5. We use the well-known correspondence between statistical mechanics and field theory in which the large cutoff limit is obtained by letting (Formula presented) reach a critical value (Formula presented) (with up to 16 significant digits in our actual calculations). We show that the round-off errors on the magnetic susceptibility grow like (Formula presented) near criticality. We show that the systematic errors (finite truncations and volume) can be controlled with an exponential precision and reduced to a level lower than the numerical errors. We justify the use of the truncation for calculations of the high-temperature expansion. We calculate the dimensionless renormalized coupling constant corresponding to the 4-point function and show that when (Formula presented) this quantity tends to a fixed value which can be determined accurately when (Formula presented) (hyperscaling holds), and goes to zero like (Formula presented) when (Formula presented). {\textcopyright} 1998 The American Physical Society.},

The effective values obtained for c show a significant decrease with L at different points along the line where the transition to the ordered phase takes place in a single transition.

abstract = {Recent work on QCD-like theories has shown that the addition of adjoint fermions obeying periodic boundary conditions to gauge theories on R3×S1 can lead to a restoration of center symmetry and confinement for sufficiently small circumference L of S1. At small L, perturbation theory may be used reliably to compute the effective potential for the Polyakov loop P in the compact direction. Periodic adjoint fermions act in opposition to the gauge fields, which by themselves would lead to a deconfined phase at small L. In order for the fermionic effects to dominate gauge field effects in the effective potential, the fermion mass must be sufficiently small. This indicates that chiral symmetry breaking effects are potentially important. We develop a Polyakov-Nambu-Jona-Lasinio (PNJL) model which combines the known perturbative behavior of adjoint QCD models at small L with chiral symmetry breaking effects to produce an effective potential for the Polyakov loop P and the chiral order parameter $\psi$̄$\psi$. A rich phase structure emerges from the effective potential. Our results are consistent with the recent lattice simulations of Cossu and D'Elia, which found no evidence for a direct connection between the small-L and large-L confining regions. Nevertheless, the two confined regions are connected indirectly if an extended field theory model with an irrelevant four-fermion interaction is considered. Thus the small-L and large-L regions are part of a single confined phase. {\textcopyright} 2010 The American Physical Society.},

abstract = {This review is devoted to the discussion of the parallel existing between four-dimensional gauge theories and two-dimensional sigma models. We use sigma models as a laboratory allowing us to investigate such issues as the operator product expansion beyond perturbation theory, vacuum condensates, low-energy theorems and other non-perturbative aspects. All these questions are intensively discussed in the current literature, and we give a critical analysis of the situation. In particular, it is explained that, contrary to recent claims, one can define the operator product expansion beyond perturbation theory in a perfectly consistent way, with no ambiguities. The second part of the review represents a detailed discussion of the supersymmetric O(3) sigma model. After a simple description of the model we concentrate on instantons. The instanton-based method for calculating the exact Gell-Mann-Low function and bifermionic condensates is described. An analogue of this method has been previously used by us in four-dimensional Yang-Mills theories. Here we try to elucidate all aspects of the method in simplified conditions. The basic points are: (i) the instanton measure from purely classical analysis; (ii) a non-renormalization theorem in self-dual external fields; (iii) existence of vacuum condensates and their compatibility with supersymmetry. Pursuing pedagogical purposes we use much space for technical details and computations. {\textcopyright} 1984.},

abstract = {The fully frustrated XY model with Villain interaction on a square lattice is studied by means of Monte Carlo simulations. On the basis of the universal jump condition it is argued that there are two distinct transitions in the model, corresponding to the loss of XY order and (Formula presented) order, respectively. The Kosterlitz-Thouless (KT) transition is analyzed by finite-size scaling of the helicity modulus at lattices of size L=32 through 128, giving (Formula presented)≈0.8108(1). The vorticity-vorticity correlation function is used to determine two different characteristic lengths, the (Formula presented) correlation length $\xi$, and the screening length $\lambda$, associated with the KT transition and free vortices. The temperature dependence of $\xi$ is examined in order to determine (Formula presented) and the correlation length exponent, $\nu$. The exponent is found to be consistent with the two-dimensional (2D) Ising value, $\nu$=1, and the obtained critical temperature is (Formula presented)=0.8225(5). The determinations of both $\xi$ and $\nu$ are done carefully, first applying the techniques to the 2D Ising model, which serves as a convenient testing ground. {\textcopyright} 1997 The American Physical Society.},

Here, we report on its local observation in a spin-polarized degenerate gas of fermions in an optical lattice. We probe the gas with single-site resolution using a new generation quantum gas microscope avoiding the common problem of light induced losses. In the band insulating regime, we measure a strong local suppression of particle number fluctuations and a low local entropy per atom.

This is a two-dimensional field theory of an N -component real scalar field which becomes interacting through the restriction T ≤ max2, for a spherical wall of radius max. The N=1 case is a string vibrating in a plane between two straight walls. We review a simple nonperturbative argument that there is a mass gap in the spectrum, with asymptotically free behavior in the coupling g= max -1, for N≥1. This scaling behavior of the mass gap has been disputed in some of the recent literature. We find, however, that perturbation theory and the 1N expansion each confirm that these models are asymptotically free. The N→∞ limit coincides with that of the O (N) nonlinear $\sigma$ model. A $\theta$ parameter and instantons exist for the two-dimensional N=2 model, which describes a string confined to the interior of a cylinder of radius max. {\textcopyright} 2005 The American Physical Society.},

The setting includes general flows in the presence of composite operators and their relation to standard flows, an important example being NPI quantities. We discuss optimisation and derive a functional optimisation criterion. Applications deal with the interrelation between functional flows and the quantum equations of motion, general Dyson-Schwinger equations. We discuss the combined use of these functional equations as well as outlining the construction of practical renormalisation schemes, also valid in the presence of composite operators. Furthermore, the formalism is used to derive various representations of modified symmetry relations in gauge theories, as well as to discuss gauge-invariant flows.

It is also available for lattice gauge theories with local gauge symmetry in dimensions d ≥ 2 and for the models obtained from minimally coupling a sigma model of the type mentioned above to a gauge theory. The duality transformation maps the strong coupling regime of the original model to the weak coupling regime of the dual model. Transformations are available for the partition function, for expectation values of fundamental variables (correlators and generalized Wilson loops) and for expectation values in the dual model which correspond in the original formulation to certain ratios of partition functions (free energies of dislocations, vortices or monopoles). Whereas the original models are formulated in terms of compact Lie groups G and H, coset spaces G/H and integrals over them, the configurations of the dual model are given in terms of representations and intertwiners of G and H.

abstract = {We analyze in detail the heating of bosonic atoms in an optical lattice due to incoherent scattering of light from the lasers forming the lattice. Because atoms scattered into higher bands do not thermalize on the time scale of typical experiments, this process cannot be described by the total energy increase in the system alone (which is determined by single-particle effects). The heating instead involves an important interplay between the atomic physics of the heating process and the many-body physics of the state. We characterize the effects on many-body states for various system parameters, where we observe important differences in the heating for strongly and weakly interacting regimes, as well as a strong dependence on the sign of the laser detuning from the excited atomic state. We compute heating rates and changes to characteristic correlation functions based on both perturbation-theory calculations and a time-dependent calculation of the dissipative many-body dynamics. The latter is made possible for one-dimensional systems by combining time-dependent density-matrix-renormalization-group methods with quantum trajectory techniques. {\textcopyright} 2010 The American Physical Society.},

This method does not rely on an iteration of renormalization-group transformations and therefore avoids the problem of fine tuning. We solve truncated versions of the fixed-point equation numerically for different values of the dimension parameter in the range 2{\textless}d{\textless}4 and different orders of truncations. The method is well suited even for multicritical fixed points with any number of unstable directions. Precise numerical data are presented for the first three nontrivial fixed points and their critical indices. We also develop an $\epsilon$-expansion for the hierarchical models using computer algebra. The numerical results are compared with the $\epsilon$-expansion. {\textcopyright} 1994 Plenum Publishing Corporation.},

We show that this can be made the basis for a proof of perturbative renormalization. We first study renormalizability in the language of renormalization group flows for a toy renormalization group equation. We then derive an exact renormalization group equation for a four-dimensional $\lambda${\o}4 theory with a momentum cutoff. We organize the cutoff dependence of the effective lagrangian into relevant and irrelevant parts, and derive a linear equation for the irrelevant part. A lengthy but straightforward argument establishes that the piece identified as irrelevant actually is so in perturbation theory. This implies renormalizability. The method extends immediately to any system in which a momentum-space cutoff can be used, but the principle is more general and should apply for any physical cutoff. Neither Weinberg's theorem nor arguments based on the topology of graphs are needed. {\textcopyright} 1984.},

abstract = {The normal and superfluid densities are defined by the response of a liquid to sample boundary motion. The free-energy change due to uniform boundary motion can be calculated by path-integral methods from the distribution of the winding number of the paths around a periodic cell. This provides a conceptually and computationally simple way of calculating the superfluid density for any Bose system. The linear-response formulation relates the superfluid density to the momentum-density correlation function, which has a short-ranged part related to the normal density and, in the case of a superfluid, a long-ranged part whose strength is proportional to the superfluid density. These facts are discussed in the context of path-integral computations and demonstrated for liquid He4 along the saturated vapor-pressure curve. Below the experimental superfluid transition temperature the computed superfluid fractions agree with the experimental values to within the statistical uncertainties of a few percent in the computations. The computed transition is broadened by finite-sample-size effects. {\textcopyright} 1987 The American Physical Society.},

It is argued that the gauge theory at the complex coupling is dual to the matrix elements of vertex operators in the de Sitter space, taken between the Bunch-Davies vacuum and the "out" state without particles.

abstract = {Objective: This study tested the hypothesis that individual and family factors associated with adolescent risky sexual behavior (RSB) operate differently in their relationship to RSB among girls who have experienced forced sexual intercourse (FSI), as compared to those who have not. Method: Data were collected from 3,863 eighth-grade girls from a larger statewide sample. Different subgroups of participants received different sets of questions, so 655 to 2548 students were included in each analysis. Multilevel modeling was used to examine relationships of individual (social negotiation skills, personal safety, depression, sensation-seeking personality) and family factors (sibling deviance, parental monitoring, and quality of family relationships) to RSB. FSI was examined as a predictor of RSB and as a moderator of the relationship between individual and family variables and sexual risk. Results: Individual predictors: Social negotiation skills were associated with lower RSB for all girls, but had a stronger relationship to RSB among girls who had experienced FSI. Depression and sensation-seeking tendencies had small positive relationships to RSB for all girls. Family predictors: For girls without a history of FSI, parental monitoring was associated with lower sexual risk behavior. However, among girls who had experienced FSI, parental monitoring was not significantly related to RSB, but sibling deviance was associated with lower RSB. Conclusions: Results suggest that social negotiation skills and parental monitoring may warrant further attention in research and intervention.},

We find evidence that corrections to a first-order transition with (Formula presented) provide the most accurate description of the data. However the corrections do not always follow the expected first-order pattern of a series expansion in the inverse lattice volume (Formula presented) Reaching the asymptotic regime will require lattice sizes greater than (Formula presented) Our conclusions are supported by the study of many cumulants which all yield consistent results after proper interpretation. {\textcopyright} 1998 The American Physical Society.},

abstract = {We all observe phase transitions in our daily lives, with hardly a second thought. When we boil water for a cup of tea, we observe that the water is quiescent until it reaches a certain temperature (100 ℃), and then bubbles appear vigorously until all the water has turned to steam. Or after an overnight snowfall, we have watched the snow melt away when temperatures rise during the day. The more adventurous among us may have heated an iron magnet above about 760 ℃ and noted the disappearance of its magnetism. Familiar and ubiquitous as these and many related phenomena are, a little reflection shows that they are quite mysterious and not easy to understand: indeed, the outlines of a theory did not emerge until the middle of the twentieth century, and, although much has been understood since then, active research continues. Ice and water both consist of molecules of H2O, and we can look up all the physical parameters of a single molecule, and of the interaction between a pair of molecules, in standard reference texts. However, no detailed study of this information prepares us for the dramatic change that occurs at 0 ℃. Below 0 ℃, the H2O molecules of ice are arranged in a regular crystalline lattice, and each H2O molecule hardly strays from its own lattice site. Above 0 ℃, we obtain liquid water, in which all the molecules are moving freely throughout the liquid container at high speeds. Why do 1023 H2O molecules cooperatively “decide” to become mobile at a certain temperature, leading to the phase transition from ice to water?},

Therefore, we present the state-of-the-art of the phase diagram for SU, Sp and SO gauge theories with fermionic matter transforming according to arbitrary representations of the underlying gauge group. We summarize several analytic methods used recently to acquire information about these gauge theories. We also provide new results for the phase diagram of the generalized Bars-Yankielowicz and Georgi-Glashow chiral gauge theories. These theories have been used for constructing grand unified models and have been the template for models of extended technicolor interactions. To gain information on the phase diagram of chiral gauge theories we will introduce a novel all orders beta function for chiral gauge theories. This permits the first unified study of all non-supersymmetric gauge theories with fermionic matter representation both chiral and non-chiral. To the best of our knowledge the phase diagram of these complex models appears here for the first time. We will introduce recent extensions of the SM featuring minimal conformal gauge theories known as minimal walking models. Finally, we will discuss the electroweak phase transition at nonzero temperature for models of dynamical electroweak symmetry breaking.},

Here we demonstrate a near-field interferometer based on the Talbot effect, which allows us to measure finite-range phase coherence of ultracold atoms in an optical lattice. We apply this interferometer to study the build-up of phase coherence after a quantum quench of a Bose-Einstein condensate residing in a one-dimensional optical lattice. Our technique of measuring finite-range phase coherence is generic, easy to adopt and can be applied in practically all lattice experiments without further modifications.},

abstract = {This paper presents a pedagogical review of duality (in the sense of Kramers and Wannier) and its application to a wide range of field theories and statistical systems. Most of the article discusses systems in arbitrary dimensions with discrete or continuous Abelian symmetry. Globally and locally symmetric interactions are treated on an equal footing. For convenience, most of the theories are formulated on a d-dimensional (Euclidean) lattice, although duality transformations in the continuum are briefly described. Among the familiar theories considered are the Ising model, the x-y model, the vector Potts model, and the Wilson lattice gauge theory with a ZN or U(1) symmetry, all in various dimensions. These theories are all members of a more general heirarchy of theories with interactions which are distinguished by their geometrical character. For all these Abelian theories it is shown that the duality transformation maps the high-temperature (or, for a field theory, large coupling constant) region of the theory into the low-temperature (small coupling constant) region of the dual theory, and vice versa. The interpretation of the dual variables as disorder parameters is discussed. The formulation of the theories in terms of their topological excitations is presented, and the role of these excitations in determining the phase structure of the theories is explained. Among the other topics discussed are duality for the Abelian Higgs model and related models, duality transformations applied to random systems (such as theories of a spin glass), duality transformations in the "lattice Hamiltonian" formalism, and a description of attempts to construct duality transformations for theories with a non-Abelian symmetry, both on the lattice and in the continuum. {\textcopyright} 1980 The American Physical Society.},

This is an important fundamental source of decoherence for current experiments, and understanding the resulting dynamics and changes in the many-body state is important for controlling heating in quantum simulators. Previously it was found that in the superfluid regime, simple observables relax to values that can be described by a thermal distribution on experimental time-scales, and that this breaks down for strong interactions (in the Mott insulator regime). Here we expand on this result, investigating the relaxation of the momentum distribution as a function of time, and discussing the relationship to eigenstate thermalization. For the strongly interacting limit, we provide an analytical analysis for the behavior of the system, based on an effective low-energy Hamiltonian in which the dynamics can be understood based on correlated doublon-holon pairs.},

Two basic "generating" equations which express the complete content of chiral symmetry are derived. The masses and coupling constants of arbitrary order for this model are simply found by differentiating the "generating" equations an arbitrary number of times and using an equation which expresses the stability of the "ground" state. In this way, previous results on this model can be easily recaptured and a systematic framework for the investigation of different symmetry-breaking terms is provided.

The consequences of imposing scale invariance on the invariant part of the interaction are also investigated by writing down a scale invariance "generating equation."

Phys. 321 2). The effective (pseudo)spin interactions making up such quantum simulators are found to be proportional to the dipole-dipole interaction between the trapped ions, and are mediated by motion that can be driven by state-dependent forces. The precise forms of the trapping potentials and the interactions are derived in the presence of an SE and a cover electrode. These results are the starting point to derive an optimized SE geometry for trapping ions in the desired honeycomb lattice of Kitaev's model, where we design the dipole-dipole interactions in a way that allows for coupling all three bond types of the model simultaneously, without the need for time discretization. Finally, we propose a simple wire structure that can be incorporated into a microfabricated chip to generate localized state-dependent forces which drive the couplings prescribed by this particular model; such a wire structure should be adaptable to many other situations. {\textcopyright} IOP Publishing Ltd and Deutsche Physikalische Gesellschaft.},

In the further development of the method, the realization that DMRG operates on a highly interesting class of quantum states, so-called matrix product states (MPS), has allowed a much deeper understanding of the inner structure of the DMRG method, its further potential and its limitations. In this paper, I want to give a detailed exposition of current DMRG thinking in the MPS language in order to make the advisable implementation of the family of DMRG algorithms in exclusively MPS terms transparent. I then move on to discuss some directions of potentially fruitful further algorithmic development: while DMRG is a very mature method by now, I still see potential for further improvements, as exemplified by a number of recently introduced algorithms. {\textcopyright} 2010.},

They argued that there is a critical number of fermions [Formula presented], above which there is no chiral symmetry breaking and below which chiral symmetry breaking and confinement set in. They further argued that the transition is not second order even though the order parameter for chiral symmetry breaking vanishes continuously as [Formula presented] approaches [Formula presented] on the broken side. In this note I propose a simple physical picture for the spectrum of states as [Formula presented] approaches [Formula presented] from below (i.e., on the broken side) and argue that this picture predicts very different and nonuniversal behavior than is the case in an ordinary second order phase transition. In this way the transition can be continuous without behaving conventionally. I further argue that this feature results from the (presumed) existence of an infrared Banks-Zaks fixed point of the gauge coupling in the neighborhood of the chiral transition and, therefore, depends on the long-distance nature of the non-Abelian gauge force. {\textcopyright} 1997 The American Physical Society.},

@article{horovod2018sergeev,
abstract = {Training modern deep learning models requires large amounts of computation, often provided by GPUs. Scaling computation from one GPU to many can enable much faster training and research progress but entails two complications. First, the training library must support inter-GPU communication. Depending on the particular methods employed, this communication may entail anywhere from negligible to significant overhead. Second, the user must modify his or her training code to take advantage of inter-GPU communication. Depending on the training library's API, the modification required may be either significant or minimal. Existing methods for enabling multi-GPU training under the TensorFlow library entail non-negligible communication overhead and require users to heavily modify their model-building code, leading many researchers to avoid the whole mess and stick with slower single-GPU training. In this paper we introduce Horovod, an open source library that improves on both obstructions to scaling: It employs efficient inter-GPU communication via ring reduction and requires only a few lines of modification to user code, enabling faster, easier distributed training in TensorFlow.

Following a presentation of the basics of the field, the book covers a wide array of central topics that have not been addressed by previous textbooks. These include a discussion of the computational complexity of learning and the concepts of convexity and stability; important algorithmic paradigms including stochastic gradient descent, neural networks, and structured output learning; and emerging theoretical concepts such as the PAC-Bayes approach and compression-based bounds.

The applicability of machine learning to this regression task is investigated, with deep neural networks found to provide an efficient solution even in cases where approaches such as principal component analysis fail.

abstract = {A systematic study is made of the non-perturbative effects in quantum chromodynamics. The basic object is the two-point functions of various currents. At large Euclidean momenta q the non-perturbative contributions induce a series in ($\mu$2/q2) where $\mu$ is some typical hadronic mass. The terms of this series are shown to be of two distinct types. The first few of them are connected with vacuum fluctuations of large size, and can be consistently accounted for within the Wilson operator expansion. On the other hand, in high orders small-size fluctuations show up and the high-order terms do not reduce (generally speaking) to the vacuum-to-vacuum matrix elements of local operators. This signals the breakdown of the operator expansion. The corresponding critical dimension is found. We propose a Borel improvement of the power series. On one hand, it makes the two-point functions less sensitive to high-order terms, and on the other hand, it transforms the standard dispersion representation into a certain integral representation with exponential weight functions. As a result we obtain a set of the sum rules for the observable spectral densities which correlate the resonance properties to a few vacuum-to-vacuum matrix elements. As the last bid to specify the sum rules we estimate the matrix elements involved and elaborate several techniques for this purpose. {\textcopyright} 1979.},

abstract = {Understanding exotic forms of magnetism in quantum mechanical systems is a central goal of modern condensed matter physics, with implications for systems ranging from high-temperature superconductors to spintronic devices. Simulating magnetic materials in the vicinity of a quantum phase transition is computationally intractable on classical computers, owing to the extreme complexity arising from quantum entanglement between the constituent magnetic spins. Here we use a degenerate Bose gas of rubidium atoms confined in an optical lattice to simulate a chain of interacting quantum Ising spins as they undergo a phase transition. Strong spin interactions are achieved through a site-occupation to pseudo-spin mapping. As we vary a magnetic field, quantum fluctuations drive a phase transition from a paramagnetic phase into an antiferromagnetic phase. In the paramagnetic phase, the interaction between the spins is overwhelmed by the applied field, which aligns the spins. In the antiferromagnetic phase, the interaction dominates and produces staggered magnetic ordering. Magnetic domain formation is observed through both in situ site-resolved imaging and noise correlation measurements. By demonstrating a route to quantum magnetism in an optical lattice, this work should facilitate further investigations of magnetic models using ultracold atoms, thereby improving our understanding of real magnetic materials. {\textcopyright} 2011 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

abstract = {We consider 3-flavour lattice QCD with a finite chemical potential mI for isospin, close to the finite temperature transition from hadronic matter to a quark-gluon plasma. In this region one can argue that the position and probably the nature of this transition mimic those at finite quark-number chemical potential $\mu$. The quark mass is chosen to be close to the critical mass at zero chemical potentials. Since the Binder cumulants used to determine the nature of this transition in HMD(R) simulations are very sensitive to the updating increment dt, we have switched to the newer exact RHMC algorithm for our simulations. Preliminary results indicate that there is no critical endpoint in the small $\mu$I regime, at least none connected with the critical point at zero chemical potentials.},

abstract = {We study QCD with 2 and 3 flavours of colour-sextet quarks. The 2-flavour theory is a candidate Walking Technicolor theory. Since we are attempting to distinguish whether this theory is walking or conformal, we also study the 3-flavour theory, which is believed to be conformal, for comparison. We simulate lattice QCD with 2 and 3 flavours of colour-sextet staggered quarks at finite temperatures to determine the scales of confinement and chiral-symmetry breaking from the positions of the deconfinement and chiral-symmetry restoration transitions. Unlike the case with fundamental quarks, these transitions are far apart. For 2 flavours the values of $\beta$ = 6/g2 for both transitions increase as Ta is decreased from 14 to 61 to 18, as expected for a theory whose coupling runs to smaller values as the lattice spacing is decreased. However, for the chiral transition, the increase in $\beta$ between Ta = 14 and Ta = 61 is much larger than the increase between Ta = 16 and Ta = 81. This suggests that between Ta = 41 and Ta = 61 we are at strong coupling where the theory is effectively quenched, while between Ta = 16 and Ta = 81 we are emerging into the weak coupling regime. It will require even smaller Ta values to determine whether the running of the chiral-transition coupling is controlled by asymptotic freedom and the theory walks, or if it reaches a non-zero limit when the transition becomes a bulk transition and the theory is conformal. The 3 flavour case at Ta = 14 and Ta = 16 behaves similarly to the 2 flavour case. Since this theory is expected to be conformal, the interpretation that we are seeing strong-coupling behaviour, inaccessible from the weak-coupling limit (continuum) is the most likely interpretation.},

Hexagonal structures play a particularly important role and lead to novel physics, such as that of carbon nanotubes or graphene. Here we report on the realization of ultracold atoms in a spin-dependent optical lattice with hexagonal symmetry. We show how the combined effects of the lattice and interactions between atoms lead to a forced antiferromagnetic N{\'{e}}el order when two spin-components localize at different lattice sites. We also demonstrate that the coexistence of two components-one Mott-insulating and the other one superfluid-leads to an interaction-induced modulation of the superfluid density, which is observed spectroscopically. Our studies reveal the vast impact of the interaction-induced modulation on the superfluid-to-Mott- insulator transition. The observations are consistent with theoretical predictions using Gutzwiller mean-field theory.},

We re-evaluate the state of the art for object recognition from small images with convolutional networks, questioning the necessity of different components in the pipeline. We find that max-pooling can simply be replaced by a convolutional layer with increased stride without loss in accuracy on several image recognition benchmarks. Following this finding – and building on other recent work for finding simple network structures – we propose a new architecture that consists solely of convolutional layers and yields competitive or state of the art performance on several object recognition datasets (CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, ImageNet). To analyze the network we introduce a new variant of the “deconvolution approach” for visualizing features learned by CNNs, which can be applied to a broader range of network structures than existing approaches.},

Simulations in the chiral limit are done on (Formula presented) lattices for exploratory purposes, and (Formula presented) lattices for quantitative purposes, and the phase diagram, parametrized by the gauge and the four-Fermi couplings, is mapped out. The line of monopole condensation transitions is separate from the line of chiral symmetry restoration as long as the four-Fermi coupling is not too small. The simulation results indicate that the monopole condensation transition is first order while the chiral transition is second order. The challenges in determining the universality class of the chiral transition are discussed. If the scaling region for the chiral transition is sufficiently wide, the (Formula presented) simulations predict critical indices far from mean field values.

abstract = {Background: Deep Neural Networks (DNN), in particular, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), has recently achieved state-of-art results for the task of Drug-Drug Interaction (DDI) extraction. Most CNN architectures incorporate a pooling layer to reduce the dimensionality of the convolution layer output, preserving relevant features and removing irrelevant details. All the previous CNN based systems for DDI extraction used max-pooling layers. Results: In this paper, we evaluate the performance of various pooling methods (in particular max-pooling, average-pooling and attentive pooling), as well as their combination, for the task of DDI extraction. Our experiments show that max-pooling exhibits a higher performance in F1-score (64.56{\%}) than attentive pooling (59.92{\%}) and than average-pooling (58.35{\%}). Conclusions: Max-pooling outperforms the others alternatives because is the only one which is invariant to the special pad tokens that are appending to the shorter sentences known as padding. Actually, the combination of max-pooling and attentive pooling does not improve the performance as compared with the single max-pooling technique.},

We argue that the effective theory possesses only short-range couplings, and hence that the finite-temperature confinement phase transition (when continuous) is accompanied by long-range fluctuations only in the order parameter.

We analyze the properties of these models that make them suitable for quantum simulations. Within this class, we study in detail the phases of a U (1) -invariant lattice gauge theory in 2 + 1 dimensions, originally proposed by P. Orland. By using exact diagonalization, we extract the low-energy states for small lattices, up to 4 × 4. We confirm that the model has two phases, with the confined entangled one characterized by strings wrapping around the whole lattice. We explain how to study larger lattices by using either tensor network techniques or digital quantum simulations with Rydberg atoms loaded in optical lattices, where we discuss in detail a protocol for the preparation of the ground-state. We propose two key experimental tests that can be used as smoking gun of the proper implementation of a gauge theory in optical lattices. These tests consist in verifying the absence of spontaneous (gauge) symmetry breaking of the ground-state and the presence of charge confinement. We also comment on the relation between standard compact U (1) lattice gauge theory and the model considered in this paper. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

We observe reduction of the autocorrelation both in symmetric and broken phase as well. Our proposing algorithm provides consistent central values of expectation values of the action density and one-point Green's function with ones from the original HMC in both the symmetric phase and broken phase within the statistical error. On the other hand, two-point Green's functions have slight difference between one calculated by the HMC and one by our proposing algorithm in the symmetric phase. Furthermore, near the criticality, the distribution of the one-point Green's function differs from the one from HMC. We discuss the origin of discrepancies and its improvement.},

abstract = {The basic frameworks and techniques of the Bayesian approach to image restoration are reviewed from the statistical-mechanical point of view. First, a few basic notions in digital image processing are explained to convince the reader that statistical mechanics has a close formal similarity to this problem. Second, the basic formulation of the statistical estimation from the observed degraded image by using the Bayes formula is demonstrated. The relationship between Bayesian statistics and statistical mechanics is also listed. Particularly, it is explained that some correlation inequalities on the Nishimori line of the random spin model also play an important role in Bayesian image restoration. Third, the framework of Bayesian image restoration for binary images by means of the Ising model is reviewed. Some practical algorithms for binary image restoration are given by employing the mean-field and the Bethe approximations. Finally, Bayesian image restoration for a grey-level image using the Gaussian model is reviewed, and the Gaussian model is extended to a more practical probabilistic model by introducing the line state to treat the effects of edges. The line state is also extended to quantized values.},

The strategy is to employ approximate RG decimation transformations of the potential moving type which give both upper and lower bounds on the partition function at each successive decimation step. By interpolation between these bounds an exact representation of the partition function is obtained on progressively coarser lattices. In the same manner, one obtains a representation of the partition function in the presence of external center flux. Under successive decimations the flow of the effective action in these representations is constrained by that in the upper and lower bounds which are easily explicitly computable. Confining behavior for the vortex free energy order parameter (ratio of partition functions with and without external flux), hence `area law' for the Wilson loop, is the result for any initial coupling.

abstract = {We point out a general problem with the procedures commonly used to obtain improved actions from Monte Carlo Renormalization Group (MCRG) decimated configurations. Straightforward measurement of the couplings from the decimated configurations, by one of the known methods, can result into actions that do not correctly reproduce the physics on the undecimated lattice. This is because the decimated configurations are generally not representative of the equilibrium configurations of the assumed form of the effective action at the measured couplings. Curing this involves fine-tuning of the chosen MCRG decimation procedure, which is also dependent on the form assumed for the effective action. We illustrate this in decimation studies of the SU(2) lattice gauge theory using Swendsen and "double smeared blocking" decimation procedures.

abstract = {The Hamiltonian formalism plays a central role in classical and quantum physics. Hamiltonians are the main tool for modelling the continuous time evolution of systems with conserved quantities, and they come equipped with many useful properties, like time reversibility and smooth interpolation in time. These properties are important for many machine learning problems -from sequence prediction to reinforcement learning and density modelling -but are not typically provided out of the box by standard tools such as recurrent neural networks. In this paper, we introduce the Hamiltonian Generative Network (HGN), the first approach capable of consistently learning Hamiltonian dynamics from high-dimensional observations (such as images) without restrictive domain assumptions. Once trained, we can use HGN to sample new trajectories, perform rollouts both forward and backward in time and even speed up or slow down the learned dynamics. 1 We demonstrate how a simple modification of the network architecture turns HGN into a powerful normalising flow model, called Neural Hamiltonian Flow (NHF), that uses Hamiltonian dynamics to model expressive densities. We hope that our work serves as a first practical demonstration of the value that the Hamiltonian formalism can bring to deep learning.},

abstract = {Perturbative coefficients for Wilson loops and the static-quark self-energy are extracted from Monte Carlo simulations at weak coupling. The lattice volumes and couplings are chosen to ensure that the lattice momenta are all perturbative. Twisted boundary conditions are used to eliminate the effects of lattice zero modes and to suppress nonperturbative finite-volume effects due to Z(3) phases. Simulations of the Wilson gluon action are done with both periodic and twisted boundary conditions, and over a wide range of lattice volumes (from 34 to 164) and couplings (from $\beta$≈9 to $\beta$≈60). A high precision comparison is made between the simulation data and results from finite-volume lattice perturbation theory. The Monte Carlo results are shown to be in excellent agreement with perturbation theory through second order. New results for third-order coefficients for a number of Wilson loops and the static-quark self-energy are reported.},

abstract = {Ultracold atomic gases in optical lattices have proven to be a controllable, tunable and clean implementation of strongly interacting quantum many-body systems. An essential prospect for such quantum simulators is their ability to map out the phase diagram of fundamental many-body model Hamiltonians. However, the results need to be validated first for representative benchmark problems through state-of-the-art numerical methods of quantum many-body theory. Here we present the first ab initio comparison between experiments and quantum Monte Carlo simulations for strongly interacting Bose gases on a lattice for large systems (up to N ≅ 3 × 10 5 to particles). The comparison enables thermometry for the interacting quantum gas and to experimentally determine the finite-temperature phase diagram for bosonic superfluids in an optical lattice, revealing a suppression of the critical temperature as the transition to the Mott insulator is approached. {\textcopyright} 2010 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

abstract = {Optical cavity QED provides a platform with which to explore quantum many-body physics in driven-dissipative systems. Single-mode cavities provide strong, infinite-range photon-mediated interactions among intracavity atoms. However, these global all-to-all couplings are limiting from the perspective of exploring quantum many-body physics beyond the mean-field approximation. The present work demonstrates that local couplings can be created using multimode cavity QED. This is established through measurements of the threshold of a superradiant, self-organization phase transition versus atomic position. Specifically, we experimentally show that the interference of near-degenerate cavity modes leads to both a strong and tunable-range interaction between Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) trapped within the cavity. We exploit the symmetry of a confocal cavity to measure the interaction between real BECs and their virtual images without unwanted contributions arising from the merger of real BECs. Atom-atom coupling may be tuned from short range to long range. This capability paves the way toward future explorations of exotic, strongly correlated systems such as quantum liquid crystals and driven-dissipative spin glasses.},

abstract = {We reconsider the conceptual foundations of the renormalization-group (RG) formalism, and prove some rigorous theorems on the regularity properties and possible pathologies of the RG map. Our main results apply to local (in position space) RG maps acting on systems of bounded spins (compact single-spin space). Regarding regularity, we show that the RG map, defined on a suitable space of interactions (=formal Hamiltonians), is always single-valued and Lipschitz continuous on its domain of definition. This rules out a recently proposed scenario for the RG description of first-order phase transitions. On the pathological side, we make rigorous some arguments of Griffiths, Pearce, and Israel, and prove in several cases that the renormalized measure is not a Gibbs measure for any reasonable interaction. This means that the RG map is ill-defined, and that the conventional RG description of first-order phase transitions is not universally valid. For decimation or Kadanoff transformations applied to the Ising model in dimension d≥3, these pathologies occur in a full neighborhood {\{}$\beta${\textgreater}$\beta$0, |h|{\textless}$\epsilon$($\beta$){\}} of the low-temperature part of the first-order phase-transition surface. For block-averaging transformations applied to the Ising model in dimension d≥2, the pathologies occur at low temperatures for arbitrary magnetic field strength. Pathologies may also occur in the critical region for Ising models in dimension d≥4. We discuss the heuristic and numerical evidence on RG pathologies in the light of our rigorous theorems. In addition, we discuss critically the concept of Gibbs measure, which is at the heart of present-day classical statistical mechanics. We provide a careful, and, we hope, pedagogical, overview of the theory of Gibbsian measures as well as (the less familiar) non-Gibbsian measures, emphasizing the distinction between these two objects and the possible occurrence of the latter in different physical situations. We give a rather complete catalogue of the known examples of such occurrences. The main message of this paper is that, despite a well-established tradition, Gibbsianness should not be taken for granted. {\textcopyright} 1993 Plenum Publishing Corporation.},

abstract = {We consider 4d compact U(1) gauge theory with extended action S=-$\beta$∑Pcos$\theta$P-$\gamma$∑P cos2$\theta$P. We give a full characterization of the phase diagram of this model using the notion of flux. The relation with the usual monopole picture is discussed. In analogy with the XY model we consider the helicity modulus [Phys. Rev. B 16 (1977) 1217] for this theory, and show that it is an order parameter. Analyzing the finite-size effects of the helicity modulus we conclude that the transition is first-order. The value of this order parameter is related to the renormalized coupling $\beta$R. We measure $\beta$cR at the transition point and give a counterexample to its conjectured universal value [Nucl. Phys. B 170 (1980) 369]. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Entanglement, one of the most intriguing features of quantum theory and a main resource in quantum information science, is expected to play a crucial role also in the study of quantum phase transitions, where it is responsible for the appearance of long-range correlations. We investigate, through a microscopic calculation, the scaling properties of entanglement in spin chain systems, both near and at a quantum critical point. Our results establish a precise connection between concepts of quantum information, condensed matter physics, and quantum field theory, by showing that the behavior of critical entanglement in spin systems is analogous to that of entropy in conformal field theories. We explore some of the implications of this connection. {\textcopyright} 2003 The American Physical Society.},

abstract = {We investigate the expansion of bosons and fermions in a homogeneous lattice after a sudden removal of the trapping potential using exact numerical methods. As a main result, we show that in one dimension, both bosonic and fermionic Mott insulators expand with the same velocity, irrespective of the interaction strength, provided the expansion starts from the ground state of the trapped gas. Furthermore, their density profiles become identical during the expansion; the asymptotic density dynamics is identical to that of initially localized, noninteracting particles, and the asymptotic velocity distribution is flat. The expansion velocity for initial correlated Mott insulating states is therefore independent of the interaction strength and particle statistics. Interestingly, this nonequilibrium dynamics is sensitive to the interaction driven quantum phase transition in the Bose-Hubbard model; while being constant in the Mott phase, the expansion velocity decreases in the superfluid phase and vanishes for large systems in the noninteracting limit. These results are compared to the setup of a recent experiment, where the trap opening was combined with an interaction quench from infinitely strong interactions to finite values. In the latter case, the interaction quench breaks the universal dynamics in the asymptotic regime and the expansion depends on the interaction strength. We carry out an analogous analysis for a two-component Fermi gas, with similar observations. In addition, we study the effect of breaking the integrability of hard-core bosons in different ways; while the fast ballistic expansion from the ground state of Mott insulators in one dimension remains unchanged for finite interactions, we observe strong deviations from this behavior on a two-leg ladder even in the hard-core case. This change in dynamics bares similarities with the dynamics in the dimensional crossover from one to two dimensions observed in the aformentioned experimental study. {\textcopyright} 2013 American Physical Society.},

We show that unsupervised learning techniques can be readily used to identify phases and phases transitions of many-body systems. Starting with raw spin configurations of a prototypical Ising model, we use principal component analysis to extract relevant low-dimensional representations of the original data and use clustering analysis to identify distinct phases in the feature space. This approach successfully finds physical concepts such as the order parameter and structure factor to be indicators of a phase transition.

In this note, we revisit their coupling and autoregressive transformation layers as probabilistic graphical models and show that they reduce to Bayesian networks with a pre-defined topology and a learnable density at each node. From this new perspective, we provide three results. First, we show that stacking multiple transformations in a normalizing flow relaxes independence assumptions and entangles the model distribution. Second, we show that a fundamental leap of capacity emerges when the depth of affine flows exceeds 3 transformation layers. Third, we prove the non-universality of the affine normalizing flow, regardless of its depth.},

abstract = {Ultracold atoms in optical lattices provide a versatile tool with which to investigate fundamental properties of quantum many-body systems. In particular, the high degree of control of experimental parameters has allowed the study of many interesting phenomena, such as quantum phase transitions and quantum spin dynamics. Here we demonstrate how such control can be implemented at the most fundamental level of a single spin at a specific site of an optical lattice. Using a tightly focused laser beam together with a microwave field, we were able to flip the spin of individual atoms in a Mott insulator with sub-diffraction-limited resolution, well below the lattice spacing. The Mott insulator provided us with a large two-dimensional array of perfectly arranged atoms, in which we created arbitrary spin patterns by sequentially addressing selected lattice sites after freezing out the atom distribution. We directly monitored the tunnelling quantum dynamics of single atoms in the lattice prepared along a single line, and observed that our addressing scheme leaves the atoms in the motional ground state. The results should enable studies of entropy transport and the quantum dynamics of spin impurities, the implementation of novel cooling schemes, and the engineering of quantum many-body phases and various quantum information processing applications. {\textcopyright} 2011 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

abstract = {Abelian and non-Abelian gauge theories are of central importance in many areas of physics. In condensed matter physics, Abelian U(1) lattice gauge theories arise in the description of certain quantum spin liquids. In quantum information theory, Kitaev's toric code is a Z(2) lattice gauge theory. In particle physics, Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), the non-Abelian SU(3) gauge theory of the strong interactions between quarks and gluons, is nonperturbatively regularized on a lattice. Quantum link models extend the concept of lattice gauge theories beyond the Wilson formulation, and are well suited for both digital and analog quantum simulation using ultracold atomic gases in optical lattices. Since quantum simulators do not suffer from the notorious sign problem, they open the door to studies of the real-time evolution of strongly coupled quantum systems, which are impossible with classical simulation methods. A plethora of interesting lattice gauge theories suggests itself for quantum simulation, which should allow us to address very challenging problems, ranging from confinement and deconfinement, or chiral symmetry breaking and its restoration at finite baryon density, to color superconductivity and the real-time evolution of heavy-ion collisions, first in simpler model gauge theories and ultimately in QCD. {\textcopyright} 2013 by WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH {\&} Co.

Sesquilinear forms in Hilbert spaces are considered in detail, analytic and asymptotic perturbation theory is described. The fundamentals of semigroup theory are given in chapter 9. The supplementary notes appearing in the second edition of the book gave mainly additional information concerning scattering theory described in chapter 10.The first edition is now 30 years old. It is a standard textbook for the theory of linear operators.},

abstract = {A generalization of the Ising model is solved, qualitatively, for its critical behavior. In the generalization the spin Sn→ at a lattice site n→ can take on any value from -to. The interaction contains a quartic term in order not to be pure Gaussian. The interaction is investigated by making a change of variable Sn→=m$\psi$m(n)Sm′, where the functions $\psi$m(n→) are localized wavepacket functions. There are a set of orthogonal wave-packet functions for each order-of-magnitude range of the momentum k→. An effective interaction is defined by integrating out the wave-packet variables with momentum of order 1, leaving unintegrated the variables with momentum {\textless}0.5. Then the variables with momentum between 0.25 and 0.5 are integrated, etc. The integrals are computed qualitatively. The result is to give a recursion formula for a sequence of effective Landau-Ginsberg-type interactions. Solution of the recursion formula gives the following exponents: $\eta$=0, $\gamma$=1.22, $\nu$=0.61 for three dimensions. In five dimensions or higher one gets $\eta$=0, $\gamma$=1, and $\nu$=12, as in the Gaussian model (at least for a small quartic term). Small corrections neglected in the analysis may make changes (probably small) in the exponents for three dimensions. {\textcopyright} 1971 The American Physical Society.},

abstract = {The scalar $\lambda$0$\phi$4 interaction and the Fermi interaction G0($\psi$̄$\psi$)2 are studied for space-time dimension d between 2 and 4. An unconventional coupling-constant renormalization is used: $\lambda$0=u0$\Lambda$$\epsilon$ ($\epsilon$=4-d) and G0=g0$\Lambda$2-d, with u0 and g0 held fixed as the cutoff $\Lambda$→. The theories can be solved in two limits: (1) the limit N→ where $\phi$ and $\psi$ are fields with N components, and (2) the limit of small $\epsilon$, as a power series in $\epsilon$. Both theories exhibit scale invariance with anomalous dimensions in the zero-mass limit. For small $\epsilon$, the fields $\phi$, $\phi$2, and $\phi$$\alpha$1•$\alpha$n$\phi$ all have anomalous dimensions, except for the stress-energy tensor. These anomalous dimensions are calculated through order $\epsilon$2; they are remarkably close to canonical except for $\phi$2. The ($\psi$̄$\psi$)2 interaction is studied only for large N; for small $\epsilon$ it generates a weakly interacting composite boson. Both the $\phi$4 and ($\psi$̄$\psi$)2 theories as solved here reduce to trivial free-field theories for $\epsilon$→0. This paper is motivated by previous work in classical statistical mechanics by Stanley (the N→ limit) and by Fisher and Wilson (the $\epsilon$ expansion). {\textcopyright} 1973 The American Physical Society.},

It is shown how to quantize a gauge field theory on a discrete lattice in Euclidean space-time, preserving exact gauge invariance and treating the gauge fields as angular variables (which makes a gauge-fixing term unnecessary). The lattice gauge theory has a computable strong-coupling limit; in this limit the binding mechanism applies and there are no free quarks. There is unfortunately no Lorentz (or Euclidean) invariance in the strong-coupling limit. The strong-coupling expansion involves sums over all quark paths and sums over all surfaces (on the lattice) joining quark paths. This structure is reminiscent of relativistic string models of hadrons. {\textcopyright} 1974 The American Physical Society.},

We considered the half-odd-integer spin-s chains, with s=1/2, 3/2, and 5/2, and periodic and open boundary conditions. In the case of the spin-1/2 chain we were able to obtain accurate estimates of the new parity exponents p$\alpha$(p) and p$\alpha$(o) that gives the power-law decay of the oscillations of the $\alpha$-R{\'{e}}nyi entropy for periodic and open boundary conditions, respectively. We confirm the relations of these exponents with the Luttinger parameter K, as proposed by Calabrese. Moreover, the predicted periodicity of the oscillating term was also observed for some nonzero values of the magnetization m. We show that for s 1/2 the amplitudes of the oscillations are quite small and get accurate estimates of p$\alpha$(p) and p$\alpha$(o) become a challenge. Although our estimates of the new universal exponents p$\alpha$(p) and p$\alpha$(o) for the spin-3/2 chain are not so accurate, they are consistent with the theoretical predictions. {\textcopyright} 2011 American Physical Society.},

The first relies on exact blocking formulas from the Tensor Renormalization Group (TRG) formulation of the transfer matrix. The second is a worm algorithm. We show that the particle number distributions obtained with the two methods agree well. We use the TRG method to calculate the thermal entropy and the entanglement entropy. We describe the particle density, the two entropies and the topology of the world lines as we increase $\mu$ to go across the superfluid phase between the first two Mott insulating phases. For a sufficiently large temporal size, this process reveals an interesting fine structure: the average particle number and the winding number of most of the world lines in the Euclidean time direction increase by one unit at a time. At each step, the thermal entropy develops a peak and the entanglement entropy increases until we reach half-filling and then decreases in a way that approximately mirrors the ascent. This suggests an approximate fermionic picture.},

When the normalizing constant varies by orders of magnitude, methods based on importance sampling can require many rounds of tuning. We present an improved approach using adaptive path sampling, iteratively reducing gaps between the base and target. Using this adaptive strategy, we develop two metastable sampling schemes. They are automated in Stan and require little tuning. For a multimodal posterior density, we equip simulated tempering with a continuous temperature. For a funnel-shaped entropic barrier, we adaptively increase mass in bottleneck regions to form an implicit divide-and-conquer. Both approaches empirically perform better than existing methods for sampling from metastable distributions, including higher accuracy and computation efficiency.},

From the field dependence of the magnetic susceptibility, we find the Kosterlitz-Thouless transition temperature to be 0.8921(19), consistent with the Monte Carlo as well as the high temperature series expansion results. At the transition temperature, the critical exponent $\delta$ is estimated as 14.5, close to the analytic value by Kosterlitz. {\textcopyright} 2014 American Physical Society.},

abstract = {Coherent many-body quantum dynamics lies at the heart of quantum simulation and quantum computation. Both require coherent evolution in the exponentially large Hilbert space of an interacting many-body system [1, 2]. To date, trapped ions have defined the state of the art in terms of achievable coherence times in interacting spin chains [3–6]. Here, we establish an alternative platform by reporting on the observation of coherent, fully interaction-driven quantum revivals of the magnetization in Rydberg-dressed Ising spin chains of atoms trapped in an optical lattice. We identify partial many-body revivals at up to about ten times the characteristic time scale set by the interactions. At the same time, single-site-resolved correlation measurements link the magnetization dynamics with inter-spin correlations appearing at different distances during the evolution. These results mark an enabling step towards the implementation of Rydberg atom based quantum annealers [7], quantum simulations of higher dimensional complex magnetic Hamiltonians [8, 9], and itinerant long-range interacting quantum matter [10–12].},

Optical dressing of ground state atoms via off-resonant laser coupling to Rydberg states is one way to tailor such interactions. Here we report the realization of coherent Rydberg dressing to implement a two-dimensional synthetic spin lattice. Our single-atom-resolved interferometric measurements of the many-body dynamics enable the microscopic probing of the interactions and reveal their highly tunable range and anisotropy.

abstract = {A quantum simulator is a restricted class of quantum computer that controls the interactions between quantum bits in a way that can be mapped to certain difficult quantum many-body problems. As more control is exerted over larger numbers of qubits, the simulator can tackle a wider range of problems, with the ultimate limit being a universal quantum computer that can solve general classes of hard problems. We use a quantum simulator composed of up to 53 qubits to study a non-equilibrium phase transition in the transverse field Ising model of magnetism, in a regime where conventional statistical mechanics does not apply. The qubits are represented by trapped ion spins that can be prepared in a variety of initial pure states. We apply a global long-range Ising interaction with controllable strength and range, and measure each individual qubit with near 99{\%} efficiency. This allows the single-shot measurement of arbitrary many-body correlations for the direct probing of the dynamical phase transition and the uncovering of computationally intractable features that rely on the long-range interactions and high connectivity between the qubits.},

Particularly intriguing are critical spin liquids, where strongly interacting excitations control low energy properties. Here we calculate their bipartite entanglement entropy that characterizes their quantum structure. In particular we calculate the Renyi entropy S2 on model wave functions obtained by Gutzwiller projection of a Fermi sea. Although the wave functions are not sign positive, S2 can be calculated on relatively large systems ({\textgreater}324 spins) using the variational MonteCarlo technique. On the triangular lattice we find that entanglement entropy of the projected Fermi sea state violates the boundary law, with S2 enhanced by a logarithmic factor. This is an unusual result for a bosonic wave function reflecting the presence of emergent fermions. These techniques can be extended to study a wide class of other phases. {\textcopyright} 2011 American Physical Society.},

A second renormalization scheme is introduced to take into account the environment contribution in the calculation of the partition function of classical tensor-network models or the expectation values of quantum tensor-network states. It improves significantly the accuracy of the coarse-grained tensor renormalization-group method. In the study of the quantum tensor-network states, we point out that the renormalization effect of the environment can be efficiently and accurately described by the bond vector. This, combined with the imaginary-time evolution of the wave function, provides an accurate projection method to determine the tensor-network wave function. It reduces significantly the truncation error and enables a tensor-network state with a large bond dimension, which is difficult to be accessed by other methods, to be accurately determined. {\textcopyright} 2010 The American Physical Society.},

That enables the simulation of CQED in 2+1 dimensions in both the weak and the strong coupling regimes, hence, allowing us to probe confinement as well as other nonperturbative effects of the theory.

abstract = {Can high-energy physics be simulated by low-energy, non-relativistic, many-body systems such as ultracold atoms? Such ultracold atomic systems lack the type of symmetries and dynamical properties of high energy physics models: in particular, they manifest neither local gauge invariance nor Lorentz invariance, which are crucial properties of the quantum field theories which are the building blocks of the standard model of elementary particles. However, it turns out, surprisingly, that there are ways to configure an atomic system to manifest both local gauge invariance and Lorentz invariance. In particular, local gauge invariance can arise either as an effective low-energy symmetry, or as an exact symmetry, following from the conservation laws in atomic interactions. Hence, one could hope that such quantum simulators may lead to a new type of (table-top) experiments which will be used to study various QCD (quantum chromodynamics) phenomena, such as the confinement of dynamical quarks, phase transitions and other effects, which are inaccessible using the currently known computational methods. In this report, we review the Hamiltonian formulation of lattice gauge theories, and then describe our recent progress in constructing the quantum simulation of Abelian and non-Abelian lattice gauge theories in 1 + 1 and 2 + 1 dimensions using ultracold atoms in optical lattices.},

abstract = {We connect explicitly the classical O(2) model in 1+1 dimensions, a model sharing important features with U(1) lattice gauge theory, to physical models potentially implementable on optical lattices and evolving at physical time. Using the tensor renormalization-group formulation, we take the time continuum limit and check that finite-dimensional projections used in recent proposals for quantum simulators provide controllable approximations of the original model. We propose two-species Bose-Hubbard models corresponding to these finite-dimensional projections at strong coupling and discuss their possible implementations on optical lattices using a Rb87 and K41 Bose-Bose mixture.},
